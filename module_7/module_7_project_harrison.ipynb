While you need not write a literature review, you should make reference to at least three scholarly articles/books that help you to frame your work. Well written articles provide a heuristic function: suggesting \"known unknowns\" worth investigating. Likewise, there is value in replicating investigations, particularly when moved to different contexts: does research on one social platform or domain apply to others? Articles that provide strong methods sections may serve as a template for your own work."
