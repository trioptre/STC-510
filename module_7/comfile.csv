George Finney released published Project Zero Trust, which offers a hypothetical scenario of an organization building their ZT strategy, and has a really good example of the role physical security plays. When they are doing their risk assessment, they identified two critical flaws in the work environment. The first was key cards were not on a separate network and not configured properly, the second was cameras would often have outages. It was all tied together with their third-party security staff using a shared login. Granted this is hypothetical, it's based on very common flaws.

An example I can think of is the Target breach. Understanding what systems can interface with sensitive data as well as any third parties involved in the process.

At the very least I would want to know if a device is plugged into the network that has the ability to talk to the hosted enviornment.

ZT seems to really only apply to software, and not hardware. As far as I'm aware, and maybe this is just my ignorance typing, but Hardware and it's firmware isn't really developed with ZT in mind, outside of perhaps some physically locked ports and signed firmware.  You can design AAA around connecting to these devices, but they aren't inherently ZT-based.  They are still connected with some fancy middleware that is coordinates that access.  When you think of an attackers landscape, all these devices are physically connected.  The only thing stopping pivots or moving through the network is this middleware.  2. Can legacy systems even support a ZT agent or some sort of ZT overlay?  What does that even look like? I'd imagine these systems need to be protected all the time due to the probable lack of support/patches.  Not to mention, access control on these systems can be extremely archaic and maybe even non-existent.  What is the mechanism to bring these systems under a ZT framework?

You'll never cover 100% of what something is with a name, people have to do some legwork themselves. Just like literally everything else.  Either way, the name makes sense to me. I'm not trusting X until Y happens. Y can be one of several different things, like coming to a "70% decision", based on whatever criteria I need to implement. In other words, I don't trust you (zero trust) until you do Y, which is something that will let me, with some confidence level, trust you to some predetermined extent.  &#x200B;  >uncontrolled trust be the primary mode of operation  "Uncontrolled trust" is such a weird way of putting it. Trust is an *active decision*, there is no "uncontrolled", otherwise it isn't "trust" anymore.",SecureWeeb,1667504226.0,68,t3_yl9kdp,yl9kdp
iuxu7ce,"I think I disagree. The idea behind zero trust is a mathematical one — at a decision point, there’s nothing in my trust boundary besides what I’ve verified myself. This is what ZT is conceptually and the name is apt.   The problem which you identify is that implementation of this mathematical model is hard, and ZT has turned into a buzzword such that many “zero trust solutions” have as much to do with ZT as JavaScript has to do with Java.",spherulitic,1667506560.0,10,t3_yl9kdp,yl9kdp
iuzo1i8,"The name originates from what trust is default, not "how much trust to reduce" (what does that even mean???)  Classic security has a hard network boundary, and those devices inside it are trusted by default.  Then there is the hybrid called "trust but verify", where you trust the device but verify the user and activity, this was the standard for many years.   "Zero trust" means you DO NOT trust a device or user or application based on the network boundary, or any other condition - you ALWAYS verify, and you CONTINUOUSLY verify.   An ideal zero trust environment does not even have a network boundary at all, every single device and service might as well exist on the public internet for all intents and purposes.  Lastly, Zero Trust can not be solved by any one product, it is a strategy and approach to security - however there ARE product classes like SASE and IDPs thay squarely fit into the Zero Trust space because they are specifically designed to help you implement that kind of approach. So, I think vendors get too much flack over this... there is nothing at all wrong with a cybersecurity vendor claiming their product helps with zero trust. Just like there is nothing wrong with an auto parts supplier claiming they enable making cars, even if they don't build the whole thing. They are still essential.",brunes,1667537378.0,7,t3_yl9kdp,yl9kdp

Most vendors just took an older solution that was not meant to enable ZT principals and tried to put a ZT label on it.  A lot of vendors claim their single solution will provide a full ZT outcome.   Honestly, ZT is an eco system solution where trust is not granted directly by having access to the system or app. You want to treat all access levels in the same basis:  trust is not default but instead assessed at the time of access (each time) based upon variables of risk: device, user role/rights and app type.",Birch_Runner,1667525217.0,6,t3_yl9kdp,yl9kdp

Arguably top level management don’t need to understand ZT. They need to understand risk and be advised of solutions/resource requirements. When speaking with execs, ESPECIALLY if you work for a cost center, you have to stop leading with technology and start addressing organizational risk. So many times I hear people pitch their projects like a university thesis:  “ZT is a set of network architecture and identity integrations that deliver the principle of least privilege and normalize access methodology between internal and external staff…[5 minutes later]…and I need money”  To execs, ZT is just a thing that closes risk.

ixypw3c,"Zero trust is very doable, but it is a journey and a mindset, and needs to be risk based in its implementation.  First, Zero Trust is a bad moniker, as it isn't zero, it is zero assumed.  When you have strong identity at the base, and good practices for permission granting and auditing, with the technical controls required, it can be a huge savings in terms of risk, monitoring, hunting, and others.  If the unpermissioned can't get TO the application, they can't get IN the application.  If the permissioned act in ways that are out of bounds and can be forcibly disconnected, or contextually reauthenticated, or flagged for immediate review, or basically any action taken to verify they are acting within the legal and ethical bounds of their access, you remove so many potential issues.       Now, if you couple those capabilities with risk analysis, and start from the inside out (which is how zero trust should be seen anyway) developing the controls, monitoring, automations, etc. for your most significant assets, where you have the justification for the time and money, you learn, develop, and reduce risk.  Then, you continue to apply those already developed system outward, down the risk register in terms of risk value, but the costs are primarily the operational increases of the volume.  The design and procurement is paid for in the early phase.  Eventually, you cover all the things that have a higher risk value than the implementation of the controls.  And, you did it the right way.  If you start at the outside, as perimeter style defenses did, then any actor "behind the wall" had open access to a lot for lateral movement, squatting, and other activities.  If the real value targets are the hardest things to crack, that matters a lot less.       To me, Zero Trust is the best reaction to date to the failings of the cybersecurity field.  If you look back over the last 40 years, the same things happen.  Credential compromise, exposed vulnerabilities that are unpatched, malware delivered to users via spam, web based attacks, or other vectors are exploited to get "inside".  Then the attacker moves around, raises privileges, etc. until they have what they came for.  If the real targets are towers of their own, to extend the old castle defense motif, and each one is independently guarded, then it doesn't matter who gets inside the castle walls.  You may want those walls for noise reduction, or to protect items that are of lesser value, but they aren't part of the real protection of the assets.",gormami,1669553045.0,14,t3_z5qyw1,z5qyw1

iy8t7l7,"It depends on the definition of Zero Trust you use. Forrester Research invented the term and say it is a strategy and framework. Zero Trust presumes threat actors are already inside your network.  Zero trust denies all access and only grants access via specific risk based policies. This applies to data, workloads, users & devices. When access is granted use least privilege possible and monitor/inspect and log all traffic. Trustworthiness must also be continually verified. How often? An hour? A day? No one knows.......and its a journey.   Zero Trust at its core assumes that threat actors are already inside your internal network and you need to prevent lateral movement. If I'm an admin on your network that will be allowed. I don't see it being prevented with most Zero Trust solutions either or an admin won't be able to do their job. In most of the recent high profile cyber attacks admin credentials were phished. Zero Trust does nothing to stop this. Hacker got password and MFA. Hacker's geolocation in the same city as the admin. Credentials are checked, roles are checked and why yes the admin does have that privilege. Game over.   You can't do other aspects of Zero Trust in the cloud either. Zero Trust states that all connections must ear trust before access is allowed. You can only do some pieces of it at the moment like user MFA, micro segmentation and IAM roles. Azure and AWS can't really do Zero Trust at the app level. There's no authentication or verification checks for the CDN to talk to the load balancers or for the load balancers talking to vms or vms to services or databases, etc.  Some generic role isn't authentication. To implement this is a nightmare. Most companies aren't even inspecting traffic in the cloud. I've seen hundreds of AWS network diagrams over the years and can probably count on my fingers how many of those even had a firewall of any kind. Security groups don't count.    Zero Trust is inherently more complicated than permitter defense and if you can't implement perimeter security right then I'm not sure how you are going to do Zero Trust where you have to know every single app flow and identify all normal patterns.   You can do user authentication using MFA and risk based policy access using Office 365 which helps prevent quite a few attacks....if you use Office 365 and Windows.",jomsec,1669740210.0,1,t3_z5qyw1,z5qyw1

It was a bit of a wild ride  First up, how he tied them together was they all responded to the same post found here: https://www.reddit.com/user/jeansmith1/comments/zbarpk/how_voip_phone_system_benefits_the_small/  Note it's a user post, which means it's generally going to have very little visibility. Looking at the comments, we can see all 3 of those accounts commented on it. They all have similar profiles, with pictures of women, similar bios, about a week old, and very odd wording on their comments (they appear to be generated by GPT-3 due to the timing and the rabbit hole eventually leading back to GPT-3)  So those 3 accounts are certainly inorganic, likely auto-generating answers to questions for karma. But there's an outlier on that post. **provengain** doesn't follow the same format at all. How odd, [let's see what he posts](https://www.reddit.com/user/provengain)  Not much interesting to look at, but one indicator that is huge is the distribution of posts. Several months of inactivity until about a week ago, the same time the above 3 bots* were created  From the provengain user page, we can easily find their [website](https://provengain.com/). In the website, we can see a LinkedIn and Facebook logo. Both go to Facebook, two separate pages. [One for the ProvenGain Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/provengain/about) and the other for the supposed [CEO of ProvenGain](https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.wildrick). Everything on the company site, facebook pages, and reddit account claim to be in California. Whois records show the domain as registered in France to a French registrar. Registrant name is redacted  My initial assessment of the company is it is dodgy, and clearly misrepresenting itself. Most times companies that present like this are outright scams, but I didn't dig further into it, because I kept following the Reddit rabbit hole. So provengains is just self promoting inorganic content through those bots. What else can we see...?  (Going to split this up into multiple comments, as it will get long)  *I'm going to be referring to "posters of inorganic content" as bots.

Before zero trust you would just need to ahthenticate the user to the first serverA and the rest are “trusted” requests that don’t need to be authenticated.",chinaisasshole,1670521943.0,1,t1_izf7c1e,zftjd9
izg7jx5,"**PART 2**  Going back to one of those 3 bots we found, BellaCollin1. We can see she posted to jeansmith1, but where else has she posted? Well, she posted to skywarditofficial  A reverse search on the profile picture turns up their LinkedIn, which includes a website and an address. Quick look at the website, they're registered through GoDaddy, and registrant is listed as Domains By Proxy, which is a registrant anonymizer. Nothing useful there  Let's look at that address from LinkedIn. On google maps, we can see a [paint store in that location](https://www.google.com/maps/@33.5556245,-117.6739145,3a,30.6y,64.38h,94.78t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s9WV7eaOnFUBmTqE8LeWZTw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). Again, doesn't say much. Look back at the website, we see a different address. This one has a google maps listing, although [I couldn't find it on street view](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Skyward+Technical+Solutions/@33.5669807,-117.6736515,3a,75y,126.85h,86.9t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sR4x_D6V4DuNC5Mwm7Pm5gw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DR4x_D6V4DuNC5Mwm7Pm5gw%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D94.730385%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192!4m7!3m6!1s0x80dceef16f1c0707:0x8ea1ff110a677d95!8m2!3d33.566972!4d-117.6735343!14m1!1BCgIgARICCAI). I don't want to dig into that one any more. I'm just going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it exists and is relatively legitimate. What happens in a lot of these cases is companies use sketchy marketing services without realizing it, which could be how they got wrapped up in this  Anyway, back to Bella Collin...  A quick read of her comments, we notice multiple distinct styles of posting  1) Very wordy responses to questions. Likely AI generated. [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/yglanc/it_services_for_small_businesses/iz3in8t/)  2) Human, no punctuation. Example: ["yup, you're right"](https://www.reddit.com/r/Managed_Services/comments/on8di1/what_is_managed_it_support/iyz16mt/)  3) Human, punctuation, poor grammar. Example: ["Thank for your thoughts Kayla."](https://www.reddit.com/r/ITSupport/comments/zajssi/is_small_business_need_it_security/iyzj6rx/)  This leads me to believe it's a shared account, but why share it?  The answer to that is likely [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeKarma4You/comments/xkwrnx/benefits_of_outsourcing_it_services_upvote_guys/izd2tck/) where they post to r/FreeKarma4You. Karma requirements make it so bots need to farm some karma. Couple interesting things here. First is our next account to check, sysvoot_community. Second is the fact she was not posting for karma. Bot accounts (again referring to generators of inorganic content) tend to use subreddits like that to gain minimum karma levels, or at least they used to. These days I typically see them using other tactics like comment copying. This leads me to my first complete hypothesis  Hypothesis: The initial 3 bots were created for guerilla marketing, and as a trial run of GPT3 generated comments for karma requirements and to appear legitimate  Next time on *procrastinating work*: The sysvoot saga begins",DevAway22314,1670535786.0,7,t1_izg0k4d,zftjd9
izgezjr,"**PART 3 take 2**  I had a bunch written up about sysvoot, but I lost it when my browser crashed, so I'm just going to give the real short version:  They are registered at and list [this residential home](https://www.google.com/maps/place/3933+Longmeadow+Way,+Fort+Worth,+TX+76133/@32.6304468,-97.3829474,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x864e6c4e8546d2d1:0xece82a621c39dd9!8m2!3d32.6304423!4d-97.3807587) in Texas as their office. They also have an Indian address. That's probably the real one  Their website also uses the same Domains By Proxy company to mask their registrant information as the past one. Doesn't tell us much.  Their main product is antivirus. The user manual is 130MB despite being only 16 pages. I opened it up with Firefox and it crashed after a little bit. I guess I'll have to make sure I didn't just infect this box. Oops.  I spent too long on them anyway. Suffice it to say they're quite sketchy. I wouldn't go so far as to say they're a scam, but I certainly would never use a company that presents like that  I'm just going to TL;DR the next few hops, I found several more similar accounts, one interesting trait I saw is them commenting on really old posts. Then I would see the OP responding as if it was helpful and not an answer to a IT question they asked months prior  There was a shit ton of some Australian blog being spammed to r/laptops and /r/GamingLaptops, from the same account over months. Weird they didn't get caught. I also saw several of the marketing accounts get their posts removed across many subreddits due to failing to meet the karma requirements, which supports the hypothesis the bots were created to subvert that. Not only can they give karma to client accounts, but they can comment on and promote those companies as well (although they don't appear to directly promote them yet, just interact with the content to help them surface higher in search algorithms)  There were some more companies like Eastern Datacomm, Silverado Technologies, and Vitel Global that present the same way doing the same things.  There are a ton of threads here that I didn't even pull on, and I have a few inklings as to the username of the person running the original bots, but nothing conclusive in that regard  **EDIT to add:**  One more that I just noticed is [this guy](https://new.reddit.com/user/lucianascotts/). A fake EC-Council. A bit of irony here that a fake EC-Council is promoting themselves with the same unethical marketing tactics that the real one uses  **Conclusion**  I believe those 3 bots are being used to promote companies for "digital marketing", and their comments are just attempts to appear more genuine and avoid karma restrictions. It is likely the bots are external to the companies being promoted. There is also likely some level of interaction trading, which is common for people trying to get exposure  I have seen many networks like this, most much more sophisticated, but this is the first instance of AI generated content for karma farming I have seen",DevAway22314,1670538846.0,8,t1_izg7jx5,zftjd9

is896vv,"In July 2020, an Azerbaijani journalist’s iPhone silently received a command to open the Apple Music app. Without the journalist’s knowledge or interaction, the app connected to a malicious server and downloaded spyware onto the phone that remained there for 17 months, eavesdropping on phone calls and text messages.    The hack was an example of a “zero-click” attack—a method of placing spyware on a phone without tricking a user into doing anything, such as clicking on a malicious link sent in an email or text message. It’s a technique that governments have utilized to target their opponents on a greater scale and for a longer duration than previously known, according to recent research from Amnesty International and Citizen Lab.  The Azerbaijani journalist—researchers didn’t disclose the identity—was a victim of spyware manufactured by NSO Group, which sells technology to governments and law enforcement agencies. The Israeli company says clients use its software to stop terrorism and curb violent crime. Some governments have misused NSO’s spyware—known as Pegasus—to target critics in more than a dozen countries, rights groups say.  NSO has helped governments hack phones with zero-click malware since at least July 2017 and has utilized at least six different zero-click exploits that were used to covertly hack Apple iOS versions 10 through 14, according to the Amnesty and Citizen Lab research, which was presented at the Virus Bulletin conference in Prague on Sept. 28.  The zero-click attacks worked by leveraging security vulnerabilities in Apple devices, in some cases sending an iMessage that would force the phone to connect to a malicious website without user engagement, according to the research. Flaws were exploited in iMessage, the Apple podcast and music apps, Apple photos and a Wi-Fi calling feature, the researchers found. In November, Apple sued NSO Group, accusing the company of “flagrant violations of US federal and state law.”",wewewawa,1665708142.0,38,t3_y3f8c7,y3f8c7

I’ve been in the cybersecurity program (different from my major of Computer Science) all 4 years and am about to graduate, and I have a cyber job lined up that I’ll start full time in May.   Making this post was misdirected, and really stemmed from the whole “if I had to suffer they should too” mentality, and some fear that my hard work to break into a sector that is so heavily gatekept would go unnoticed.

Yes, it does take a lot of learning to be proficient in, and I think at this point I have done enough that I will do well at my entry level job as my school did a great job creating their cyber program.   However, there is a lot of the sentiment in the field that in order to be someone who is “able to be good at cyber” you have to already know xyz technical terms, and sometimes they just throw all the fancy acronyms at you to make themselves feel smarter, and you feel less competent, even though it’s just some acronyms, or a very specialized skill they know.

GRC folk, IMHO, are critical for that.  Now, having said that, I also don't think you can easily walk into GRC without any technical understanding, and certainly without any knowledge or experience in cross pollinated disciplines like Audit etc. In fact, on the audit and assessment side, I'll die on that hill; nothing more irritating than a GRC "Pro" that doesn't see or understand the value in being technically conversant in the stuff they are reviewing / auditing / assessing etc. If my name's on the report or tied to the findings, I'll do my due diligence and make sure it's accurate.

If my company hires a junior penetration tester, I fully expect that I’ll need to teach them things. Teaching things like reflective DLL injection, AV bypass techniques, and a general mindset of going low and slow, sure. Teaching someone how to utilize reflectors in the cloud, or how set up pivot tunnels, also more than happy to teach. I get genuinely excited to teach people new things, and cherish the opportunities I get.  I get frustrated when I have to teach someone how to use SSH in general. I get frustrated when I ask for someone to send me their public SSH key so I can send it over to the business area who needs it to set up the jump server required for us to access the testing environment and the new junior tester doesn’t know what an SSH key is or how to generate one.  I don’t care what certs or degree someone has, but I do care that they are able to perform the basic, every day tasks required of them when they get hired. If that don’t have that, it sounds more like school or an apprenticeship to me, and I would expect the pay to reflect that, right?  I think part of the problem here is that there is no defined and mutually understood floor when talking about a “technical background” or prerequisite skills/abilities. I mean even the IBEW requires Apprentice applicants to pass an entrance exam that heavily focuses on the core skills that will be built upon over the course of the apprenticeship, does that constitute gatekeeping?  Another big complaint is the salary drop when people shift careers. Again using the IBEW as an example, the  typical range for an IBEW Apprentice salary in my state falls between $46,500 and $61,900 a year. I’ve seen people complaining that dropping back to $60-70k a year is to much and constitutes gatekeeping.  Every conversation around this topic is so vague. I’m coming in to it with the experience of reviewing applications to Red Team roles in an organization that had developed a VM team and penetration testing team, and allowed them time to mature, before ever starting up a dedicated red team. People are applying with like a Sec+ and no relevant work experience whatsoever. You can’t *really* expect my company to hire someone with a resume like that straight on to our red team, can you? How is it gatekeeping for a company to want applicants to have experience in roles that perform testing mainly in Dev or QA environments before hiring them in to a position that’s performing actions on prod systems, including potentially both business critical servers and in-use end user machines?

I've been involved in the hiring process and have given negative reviews due to a lack of credentials or a lack of demonstrable experience.    But neither certificates nor a BSc really prepare you for the field, especially blue or red OPS, the way mentoring and a legit apprentice, journeyman, master structure would. Or just dogged self-study and training.   I dunno, I was born in the 80s, started programming in middle school (BASIC lol), and didn't get into hacking until the 2000s. I kinda missed the boat, but I could also he romanticizing what used to be about how to write malware has become how to pass this vendor's cloud security cert.     Sure, it may have some useful vendor specific information, but honestly... It's corporatized and borderline predatory.  What I mean is... there are really two faces to this industry. One that is still about hacking and detecting, and another that is about credentials and HR filters. And these credentials don't exactly equate to competence either. (I'm not talking about GRC. It's outside of scope. That is really tertiary to information security, and I mean no disrespect by asserting that.)  In now way can Sec+, CEH (lol) or even OSCP prepare you for the 2 AM call that a facility has been hit with ransomware, and oh yeah, this was a recent acquisition, and due to office politics, their systems were joined to the parent domain without the security team being notified.     Nor can a BS in Cyber (dear god) prepare you for your first day on the job as a security engineer when you realize the org has a backlog a mile deep and organizationally doesn't even know where to start with generating accurate risk metrics or situational awareness. Oh, and they want to greenfield a cloud environment for their globally remote dev workforce starting next quarter.       This is why most breaches happen. Not because of analysts' and engineers' incompetence. But because business decisions are made without adequate risk assessments ... or they don't care about the assessment.  That's what insurance is for.    Honestly, I've not seen either insurance carriers or lawyers go after an engineer or analyst following a breach. I know companies do get sued for gross negligence of basic security practices, but at that point, the fault is on upper management and leadership.

As a specialized "I," what should I focus on to become a "T"? What are CEOs looking for in broadness?   On the other hand, it almost sounds like wanting specialists to burn both ends. It takes a lot of time to become a specialist. I just spent my weekend learning how to write my own PE crypter in a specialized language. And I've just scratched the surface. It's fine because my work is something I really enjoy. But I also make sure I have time for family and hobbies that have nothing to do with information security or computers.

Having recently patched authentication bypass vulnerabilities in multiple systems, I know exposing services to the public Internet that don’t need to be is reckless. The VPN stops hundreds of attacks a day.  My second issue is zero trust has been the policy everywhere I’ve worked for 20 years. I guess there’s some companies somewhere that might trust the network, but I’ve never seen it. Sys admins and security professionals have known not to trust networks for decades.

Level of effort is not understood by leadership   If people want to follow NIST 800-207 and the guidance in the google white papers, the level of effort is tremendous.   &#x200B;  3. Datacenter network segmentation   This is especially true with segmenting the network behind the applications, from a standards perspective all connections between applications should be limited to only the ports and protocols that are required.  This means that you need to have complete application dependency mappings which no one has for their environments. There are some solid platforms out there that can help build application dependency mappings and micro-seg like Guardicore (no I do not work for them or sell them)   &#x200B;  4. RBAC for applications and application access reviews  Again if you look at Zero Trust specifications from NIST and the white papers from google. Access to environments is conceptually broken down into 2 phases, access to the network, and access to the application. Many organizations do not have good identity governance with solid RBAC programs in place to manage application access.   &#x200B;  Summary:   * Zero Trust is not something you can buy * It's not something that any one department within an organization can accomplish on their own * It's a deeply collaborative organization wide initiative which the information security industry (in general) does a horrible job on.

i774b24,"The rest of the comments have made great points and I would like to highlight how vendors have co-opted the term for products that are not actually ZT.   This does mean that the human reaction is to immediately disregard anything that markets itself as ZT **because of the effort required to confirm that a product fits within ZT.** And unless the product is open-source, how do you really confirm it?   (The irony here is that it's good to have zero trust for vendors because "Is what you're saying about your product true? Can we continuously confirm that this is true?" is a fundamental aspect of ZT, so you're technically putting ZT into practice already.)  It doesn't help that decision-makers may think ZT is a purchasable product, voila, buy X have ZT. There's a significant amount of organization-wide shift for a ZT-oriented posture that makes cybersecurity professionals groan because they're going to be responsible for driving the cart except the cart does not want to move, saying "We bought you the new wheels!"  The good news is that not only has the [White House come out to say ZT is the future] (https://www.pomerium.com/blog/white-house-zt-memo/), they've broadcasted CISA's ZT model as the de facto guide. Cybersecurity experts that understand the value of ZT and *do* want to evaluate vendor products/tools for ZT-capabilities should use CISA's guide as a standard to cut through marketing fluff.  In our [Q&A interview with Scott and Oliver, the writers of that NIST 800-207 publication,](https://www.pomerium.com/blog/zta-qa-nist/) they also admit that there's a lot of confusion surrounding the term.

Others say you can get rid of other security measures too.  The first problem is for companies to try and figure out what is what when it comes to Zero Trust. The next real problem in most organizations is identifying all applications, users, devices and inter app connectivity required to even start zero trust. Then you have to implement authentication at every layer of the stack. You also need to authenticate every device. IP Phones, faxes, security cameras, AV equipment, displays and more. Many of these cannot even do authentication, you can only whitelist which isn't zero trust.  Furthermore, in the cloud some basic scenarios can't even be properly done without massive re-architecting many apps. External user hits website via AWS ALB, then hits EC2 instance which may talk to S3 and an RDS cluster. Each of those inter app connections need to be authorized and allowed, every connection.  There is no mechanism to allow an ALB to authenticate with an EC2 instance. You have to jump through a lot of hoops to re-architect and implement zero trust for a simple scenario.  Zero Trust for user authentication is great though as we currently use that and it has saved us.

A zero trust architecture (ZTA) uses zero trust principles to plan industrial and enterprise infrastructure and workflows. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust is a response to enterprise network trends that include remote users, bring your own device (BYOD), and cloud-based assets that are not located within an enterprise-owned network boundary. Zero trust focuses on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource. This document contains an abstract definition of zero trust architecture (ZTA) and gives general deployment models and use cases where zero trust could improve an enterprise’s overall information technology security posture. - Scott Rose (NIST), Oliver Borchert (NIST), Stu Mitchell (Stu2Labs), Sean Connelly (DHS)  And nowhere does it say anything about dissolving any compartmentalization or internalization of a network.

i75tzkk,"I'm not sure I am getting your point about trusted networks.  The way I've been describing zero trust to nontechnical folks is that current network design is often like shopping in a grocery store.  If you get through the front door, you have access to whatever is available.  There are some limitations, like additional age verification to buy tobacco or alcohol.  But basically once you get inside (are you wearing shoes/shirt?) then you're all good.  That's how most (legacy) VPNs work.  You connect, and you have IP level connectivity to things that you may not be authorized to access.  And while you may never try to access those things--and wouldn't be able to get in if you tried--that doesn't mean the risk isn't there for a motivated attacker to leverage that connectivity.  ZT is about switching from the grocery store model to shopping in a pitch black cave with a tiny flashlight.  You are only authenticated to access the one thing that your flashlight is pointing to.  You can't even see the other options on the shelves.  And once you get that one thing, if you need something different the process starts over.  ZT is about making real-time, discrete risk assessments tied to identity.  Being in a physical location--in a corporate building, or on the corporate VPN--should not confer any special access rights.  As someone downthread already pointed out, most people don't understand that you have to completely overhaul your directory service and access model to achieve this.  So yes, one of the implications of the ZT framework is that you can expose applications directly to the internet.  That doesn't mean that you don't have to do all the other work to secure them.  But it does mean that even if that one application is popped, it doesn't lead to access to other things.",philgrad,1651587048.0,8,t1_i75gmo6,uhe5ip

The access proxy should be placed in front of all applications as policy enforcement points.  ADCs are a good place to enforce policy (see DoD ZT reference architecture 1.0). Key thing is to perform continuous validation across the key telemetry points that allowed the initial resource access and then some. For example, telemetry at the IDP, but also different/expanded telemetry at the VPN gateway and Access Proxy. The tenet is a multi-point, multi-vector approach such that an allegedly compromised IDaas (sup Okta) doesn't lead to a unauthorized access to resources.  Now one of NIST's ZT tenets from 800-207 says that "Access to individual resources is granted on a per-session basis".  This is where I disagree, it should be that "Access to individual resources is granted on a per-request basis; where possible".  Why per-request, because it allows me granular re-entry into a policy decision based upon changes in context. For example, started the session with a compliant device from a Comcast subscriber network;  continued the session from a TOR exit node, from a non-compliant device.

ig3y85v,"One purpose of ZTNA for access to corporate applications is to make internal networks obscure to users. Whereas a traditional VPN would authenticate a user once, and effectively place the user inside the network giving them a lot of access/visibility that they probably don't need. If their machine became compromised, an attacker would be inside the network.  Using ZTNA means that a user gets authenticated, but are only be able to request access to a resource that they are authorized for. There will typically be an agent on the user device, and all connection requests are sent over an encrypted tunnel towards the ZTNA solution (usually a SaaS based gateway), which will perform additional security checks and then forward the connection onto the internal application.  The other aspect is providing secure user access to cloud apps and websites. Traditional VPN's would either send ALL user traffic via the corporate network in order to control user internet access (not practical), or simply allow all user internet traffic to break out locally, which means they completely lose visibility of what applications/sites users are accessing (major security risk).  The agent on the device will continuously monitor for specific activity/indicators that could pose a risk to the organization, and then revoke access.  ZTNA doesn't HAVE to replace traditional VPNs, but I would certainly question why anyone would want to have both. It does require a business to know what each employee requires access to though, in order to provide the best user experience. Also with traditional VPN access, businesses would often have to spend a lot of money upfront to buy a firewall/VPN device that can handle the user traffic, but with ZTNA this upfront cost is eradicated, as ZTNA solutions are cloud-native and are built to scale automatically to handle traffic demands. There could also be some conflict trying to run ZTNA agent + traditional VPN agent on the same machine, as both solutions would be trying to send connections over their tunnels, so it would require traffic to be well organized.

Now, you used the word automation which falls under a process flow of *something* and increases efficiency as a result.

Look, I don't think it necessarily a bad thing to look at how we do something in a different way or think outside the box.  However, I just don't see how ZT is bringing anything new to the table.

Adaptive auth is a relatively recent capability that is critical.  EUBA has also been around for a few years now.  Granted, it has been used to prevent malicious threats via the integration of network devices/systems with a SIEM or other IDR products and maybe not so much from authentication and authorization perspective, but why would you want to automate that? Security is not supposed to be convenient.  Granted there are more efficient ways of accomplishing things but I'm not sold on the idea that I would want a system dictating the type of access an individual receives based on how they are connected.  That should really be determined right from the start (Standards).  That way you know its in place and its not going to potentially break and do something that you wish for it not to do.  I'm all for new and efficient ways of doing things, but I think we really need to tread lightly on how we proceed.

ilpqzun,"Are you just looking to understand Zero Trust, or are you looking for controls around a specific architecture or project?  Individual controls are not Zero Trusty, the combination of them is.  In whatever environment you are looking at, you need to be able to positively identify each connection, allow only the authorized connections, and be able to monitor/stop them.  You can do that in a lot of ways, so it is difficult to look at specific controls.  If you are getting a general sense, think in broad terms. How do I identify users/connections?  Username/password, too weak.  MFA?  How good is it, can it be spoofed? Can I gather the IP the users are coming from as part of the identification, and verify where it comes from?  Cryptographic identity (X.509 or similar)?  How do I authorize them?  Role based?  Individual?  Real time?  Then you get into the hard part, how do I stop lateral movement?  How do I allow access to the web app, but not the database port?  These are the things you have to think through, and develop a plan.  If you are learning, I would model out a small architecture, then think through all these steps, and those found in the NIST documents, the new Maturity Model and 800-207, to help wrap your head around the problems.     In the end, it takes a multitiered approach.  Secure the app AND secure the network, separately, and you have built in MFA i done right, then you can layer others on top. Working for [NetFoundry](https://www.netfoundry.io), I would be remiss if I didn't say to take a look at our method, or the open core project [OpenZiti](https://www.github.com/openziti), for a product that provides the needs for securing the network, and if you own the application and are developing it, provide SDKs for embedding the solution directly into your software, with the same control plane for all levels (Network, Host, or embedded).",gormami,1661422843.0,1,t3_wwnj77,wwnj77

Do you implement any type of fingerprinting, IP, domain membership, running processes, etc. to determine the node the access is coming from should be trusted? 3. How are users authorized to access resources, and what granularity of control do you have at a network level?  If a user can reach port 443 on a server, can they also reach port 22?  How do you stop them from doing that?    1. Properly granular least privilege access methods are a control. 4. How do you control lateral movement between resources?  If a server were accessed, "legally" or not (ssh to a node, for instance), how do you stop that user from sshing OUT of the box to something else, or any other service?  This is the big weakness of perimeter models, at whatever level.  Maturing towards Zero trust means smaller and smaller perimeters, hence the term microsegmentation.    1. Proper segmentation is a control 5. How is activity logged?  Can you feedback from the resources in your network to some sort of system that can revoke user access in real time?    1. Continuous authentication is a control  Obviously, there are hundreds of technical solutions to these questions.  The exact methods will differ widely.  However, these, and probably a few others I am forgetting at the moment, are the core tenets of Zero Trust as defined by NIST.

This is a real-world scenario of how a threat actor would exploit a home office, so we wanted to include it here, too. It works like this; a contest picks a router and begins by exploiting the WAN interface. They must then pivot into the LAN to their choice of second target – one of the other devices in the contest. For example, you could pick the TP-Link router and the HP printer. If you compromise both, you’ll win $100,000 and 10 Master of Pwn points."*",Daniel_SalesEngineer,1661794581.0,6,t3_x0ujl7,x0ujl7

What you need to do is to start with a risk based approach, figure out where most of your risk is, and start there.  Protect PII, PHI, OT, intellectual property, etc. as your larger risk items.  Are you going to take the time to implement continuous auth and MFA to the department printer?  Probably not.  But the database that might be routable FROM that printer, absolutely, as you protect it from everything else.

j90k001,"This post, hurts, and I am very sorry for you. Here's the help I can offer to ease your pain, at least a little:  First step- Use CyberCNS (now ConnectSecure) instead of Qualys. It's far cheaper with 10k covered devices/endpoints at like $300?/month and it has great reporting with IMO better UI and learning curve if needed. This is going to get you up to speed real quick  Next- Get **VERY** hands on with some Microsoft labs, certs, tutorials, whatever you can find. You're going to want to throw a P1 license on every user, as well as a Defender for Business license for every machine. I think public pricing for those is like $5-6/user for P1 and $3/endpoint for DFB. Alternatively upgrade everyone to M365 Business Premium for a more holistic approach that also offers other great features and has the productivity suite. The reason I'm suggesting this is because you also get Intune which helps manage your device nightmare plus it includes all the security tools you're going to need to bail this sinking ship out. Getting intimately familiar with Azure AD and on prem AD with AAD Connect (or even better AADDS) is the way to go. Defender for Business is a top rated Gartner magic quadrant contender and more importantly- it's accepted as a valid and preferred EDR solution for almost all cyber insurance vendors.  Intune+Defender to lock down and secure endpoints combined with GPO and vuln management and monitoring from CyberCNS fixes your endpoint security issue. Data security and general organizational security is solved by using highly tuned conditional access, RBAC, information protection, and SSO provided by Business Premium. This doesn't fix 100% of your issues, but it's a great start. Almost forgot that BP (please don't quote me on this I'm like 99% sure) allows you to import a ton of data from the tenant into Microsoft Sentinel for free which saves you the cost of implementing a SIEM while still giving you audit logs and actionable information.  Regarding firewalls/network security- I don't know what your network structure is like, but you may consider an AOVPN ZTNA/SASE solution if you have a lot of users doing work from home or you lack appropriate network infrastructure/security currently. I like pfsense firewalls- They're my favorite solution at the moment. If you want to go with something much more expensive, but also possibly easier for you to manage then Fortinet isn't a bad choice, just don't use their other products if you can help it. If you need enterprise wifi I like Ubiquity a lot right now and I've been using them religiously for the last 8 months. A word of caution- never use their firewalls, they're not great and the routing is problematic sometimes. Unifi wifi stuff is very good though and has no annual fees so it can be an easier sell to management if you think you need an upgrade. Host the controller in the cloud: Hostifi is a good solution so you don't need to add another thing to your plate.  &#x200B;  I'm sorry if I didn't address everything here, I'm half asleep at 3am :D For context here, my recommendations come from a place of successful adoption. It can be an incredibly difficult pill for management to swallow when you go from zero security and zero spend to 100mph full speed ahead blank check- especially since your management clearly doesn't understand the value of it. At $22/user/month you can solve most of your outstanding issues for ultimately very little cost. Since you don't have a big team to handle the implementation and upkeep of a solution, it's crucial that you can actually use it. Tools do you no good if the hands can't wield them, and a person with unlimited access to the finest tools and materials in the world cannot build a house if they have no knowledge of the process. In my personal experience I think this may be the rest route forward for your organization. If you have any more questions just ping me; always happy to help.  &#x200B;  PS: You're going to want them to pump the brakes on that SOC 2 audit for at least 3 months.

j5sasuf,"Thank you for the questions! Our target market is anyone new to the DFIR space that already has some foundational CS/sys admin-type skills. So most college grads, anyone with any kind of IT background, etc. Our free course is designed to be digestible as a whole or in parts depending on what information you need to know. It can be a quick reference on specific tasks like imaging with FTK, or as a whole, it's a holistic 101 intro to the space.   The private sector is a lot faster moving, because of the amount of money that is being lost if you're down, and a lot less red tape because red tape ends up costing money in an emergency. The public sector, in my experience, is just glacial in pace in comparison. Also finding funding for training, tools, personnel, etc can be a lot harder in the public sector due to the size of budgets.   *Most* DFIR vendors that do TA comms are going to do it presenting as a member of the victim organization, like some first-line or mid-level manager.  The typical approach is to play dumb and walk into a negotiation with a 'who are you and why have you done this to us, I've never experienced this before' persona. There are several goals including proving any claims (can they actually decrypt data if they encrypted? Do they have data they claim to have stolen or just a list of files?), stalling (gives time to legal/PR/C-suite to prepare memos or decide on a course of action, and giving IT time to see if backup recovery will work), driving the cost down (often enough you see 40-90% decreases in demands over time), and then validating what you get back (i.e. making sure a decryptor works).  Some firms don't do this and will come out and say 'we're XYZ, you know our reputation give us your lowest price and we'll get you paid'.",Zikamiri,1674623460.0,3,t1_j5s7v5q,10khl4i
j5w0dbi,"Hi there! We absolutely understand your pain, that is a common issue, training is hard to get especially within DFIR! That's the main reason we started PPR. I'd take a look at images from CFREDS, and CTF sites like TryHackMe and HackTheBox for DFIR specific images. I also wouldn't underestimate the value in doing some of the red stuff too, you'll have a better understanding of how to catch Mimikatz if you know how to use it, y'know? Between those three options, you can probably drum up some healthy competition within the team with a set of questions they should be really proficient at answering quickly (what is this box for, what is the hostname, what is the IP, are their weird scheduled tasks, processes, users, browser history, etc? What is normal and what is weird?) In our experience that approach can make things fun and build muscle memory. So you go grab those images, crack them open in tools likeEZTools, and Autopsy (that are free), and see who gets the answers first, most accurate, etc. And then have them teach one another, present those findings to the rest of the team.   As a total tangent, I'm sure you're intimately aware of this; but their ability to present their findings in an effective manner, and in language that the leadership of the organization are going to be able to understand and care about (i.e. We found this Mr. CFO, and here's what it means to your MRR/ARR or here's what it'll cost to remediate if we don't have a way to deal with it.) Is what will take them from good to great. Coming from the vendor space, you pretty much cannot do the job without those soft skills at most companies.  For training up new folks, it's encouraging a culture of trying their best to answer their own questions first, but also having judgement for when something is urgent enough that they need to get support and not be afraid to ask questions. Once they're comfortable with that, it's just repetitions. Reviewing images over and over, especially these CTFs where you know something bad happened. Can't find any new images? Go make some. Task some of them with doing bad stuff on a VM, capturing that image, and then going back and finding and documenting it. In the U.S. Army there's a saying "train like we fight"; which means we have to simulate the real world "combat" scenario as closely as possible when we're training, including the extreme stress, tight timelines, etc. If they have the right attitude for the gig and you make it fun so they don't burnout, you'll galvanize them into rockstars pretty quickly.

j5u8eta,"Great question! I will tackle this question by question.  **#1** The great thing about learning cybersecurity nowadays is that there is plenty of resources to jump right into a specific field. So, when people are just getting into the cybersecurity, I suggest exploring the various fields, figuring out which interests you (sounds like DFIR, good choice!), and diving right in. Learn the tools for the jobs, and build playbooks (for example, create a checklist for analysis steps to detect malware on a forensic image). DFIR is an excellent route for curious people, who love to learn, and have a knack for explaining things to others,  these individuals would be very well suited for DFIR. You will always need to think of creative ways to look for malicious artifacts, DFIRs are constantly learning and using new tools to help with your analysis. You will want to be able to share that knowledge after you discover your findings.  **#2** That is a great plan, but if you know DFIR is the route, there are many onramps to a DFIR career at an entry-level position. From there, if you are diligent in learning, you will be able to pick up the IT/SOC experience over time from interacting with people in that role. So it depends on how fast or slow you want to get into DFIR; both paths are good options.  **#3** Excellent, DFIR has come a long way since I started; nowadays, you rarely need to go onsite, and most of the time, the only reason is that the client is unable to do the technical functions to get you artifacts or they need advisory support. Many positions in DFIR are purely analyst type doing the technical side, and an incident commander handles all client interactions.",mikiozen,1674664686.0,3,t1_j5tup4v,10khl4i
j5vxlyy,"I like lists, let's do it!  1. Required? Absolutely not. Does it help you have a deeper understanding of how computers work, and will it help your career long time? Definitely.  2. So entry-level and DFIR are kind of tricky to put together. Most of the time you start as an engineer, admin, etc, and then go get trained in DFIR. That being said, there is a growing trend of vendors hiring more and more "entry-level" folks. Titles would be something like an associate or junior DFIR consultant or analyst. You can also start as a SOC analyst and focus on the IR needs of the organization. Typically folks stay in DFIR for a while because it's one of the highest-paid and most varied niches within cybersecurity. The glass ceilings are quite high, and you can move into management of IR teams or entire security programs from that experience. If you didn't want to go that route, some folks go into security research (that's what TJ did!) The beauty of infosec is essentially any other niche you want to come from or go into all have skills that translate really well. 3. Personally I prefer working for vendors whenever possible because you're a source of revenue not a bill to pay. You'll find many openings there. Other options include very large companies that can afford to have incident responders on staff. Industry wise it is varied, you'll find opportunities in retail, finance, healthcare, etc. You won't really see anything too unique if you are working in a specific industry unless you're talking like OT/ICS. Finance will have a lot of attempts at credential theft and FFT. Healthcare you'll have to deal with old equipment on the network (like MRI machines, etc.). 4. We offer both a free and paid course (take both!) for an introduction to DFIR, and will be developing additional course material over the coming months and years. Our paid course is essentially a mini-GCFA for a tiny fraction of the cost (GCFA is around 8k, ours is 150$). That being said, SANS is an extremely well respected organization that has great coursework if you can afford it. The GCFA by itself usually auto-qualifies you for interviews. There are other courses as well out there for varying prices and levels of quality.  Misc.  1. It depends on who you ask but in my experience most people in private sector will never be called as an expert witness. Working in IR, it is exceedingly rare. If you go work for law enforcement then your chances are quite high. If you're talking about regular porn, you'll run into it relatively often as you find a lot of C-Suite members will treat their work laptop as their personal and visit all kinds of sites. However you'll not need to actually view that material, you'll just see google searches or domain hits in browser history....unless they're actually downloading stuff on the machine. In those cases you usually raise it to the client and move on. If you're talking about CSAM, it is absolutely a possibility that you run into it; but again I think most people will go their entire careers without seeing it if you're only in private sector. I have not and pray that I never do. 2. Working for a vendor, the main two types of cases we see are Business E-mail Compromise (BEC) and Ransomware/Data Theft Extortion. That's across industries and it varies year over year what industries get hit the hardest. Finance, government, education, and healthcare tend to be the top ones.

j5zci0w,"Certainly pretty open-ended questions but really important ones that everyone always asks. We could go on forever about should coulda woulda; but here the first few that come to mind:  Building and practicing your Incident Response Plan (IRP). The technical, the policy, the procedures, all of it. You should have SOPs broken down so that an intern in college can follow it. Your decision makers (i.e. check signers) should be aware of when to break glass and how to get the proper authorizations for those expenditures (new hardware like extra drives to put images on, hiring external counsel, paying insurance deductibles, hiring a DFIR team, an IT recovery team, paying for notifications if necessary, etc.), and your lesser-thought-of stakeholders in the process need to be aware of their part. You need to know what external you're gonna use and establish relations with them, you should have a PR and HR rep prepared for internal and external messaging, stuff like that. Most orgs don't have this process established at all.  Secondly I would say focusing on your edge network. Let's say a Fortigate patch came out a little while ago, how fast was that patched? Keeping those appliances up to date and with best practice configs is critical. I'll attach fundamental security knowledge to this as well, I have had my fair share of cases where they said "I moved RDP to something other than 3389 so I thought I was good"  Third would be backups. Make sure they work. Check often (at least every 6 months). Make sure they work in a timely fashion (if it takes two weeks to pull stuff off tapes, that won't work for most organizations). Isolate them, because if a Threat Actor can get to them and destroy them, they will.  Finally is east west monitoring. Most companies, once you're inside the network there's no real awareness of traffic internally. Setup honey pots, internal firewalls, etc. If they don't stop it, they'll at least help in isolation, investigation, and recovery significantly.  Honorable mentions are things like get an EDR, prioritize knowledgeable and dedicated staff over tooling, etc.  &#x200B;  From a containment perspective, a lot of it is similar. EDR is a game changer for containment. Making sure your FW admin is capable of quickly making changes as needed. Having the ability to quarantine specific parts of your network instead of having to do all or nothing. Turning on EVTX monitoring 4688 and 4663 (which are off by default) doesn't directly help containment, but helps you know what to contain (i.e. where something is coming from). Having a tested game plan for resetting AD creds and rotating kerberos TGT across the entire domain quickly and completely will help you stop the bad guy, or at least delay until he is able to get creds again.",Zikamiri,1674751949.0,2,t1_j5y3rvb,10khl4i
j5zgzhe,"Hmm that's a good one. Most tools are pretty well circulated. Some more obscure ones might be like trugglehog for scraping github for hard coded secrets/creds. I like to use NTFS Log Tracker to quickly find things in the $MFT and $J, it's a better method than just $MFT for finding deleted files (i.e. data exfil). Photorec is my go-to for file carving. IPNetInfo is nice for pulling WHOIS info en masse. ZoomEye is the Chinese alternative to Shodan and sometimes has different results.  IANAL; but the general recommendation from privacy counsel we often work with is to keep things need to know as much as possible. Your C-Suite and board need to be aware but Nancy from HR probably does not. This helps prevent leaks, you'd be surprised how many people want to be the first well to tell the local news station. It also can limit the immediate internal fallout, so people will just shrug and say huh something weird is going on with the internet, not full-on panic in a crowded theater. After the incident, it depends really on the perspective of the leadership and counsel. Personally, I am a fan of as much transparency as makes sense without compromising your business any further. Philosophically I subscribe to the belief that being open about your struggles ends up looking better in the public eye in the long run. You get to set the record straight and it takes away the ability of journalists or competitors to use speculation against you. Straight out of Dale Carnegie's book.

j63kxce,"As someone in your age range there are definitely pros and cons. Once you get some experience, although it’s subtle age discrimination, people like the Boards of Directors and counsel tend to prefer to deal with older people (even if the younger are more senior).   The big downside is the lifestyle for a lot of jobs in this field. Although not always true, this work often comes with an on call rotation where your weekends may be interrupted or you are woken up in the middle of the night, sometimes long days and overnighters, and travel. If your old bones are cool with getting dragged out of bed at 2AM or working an 18+ hour day, and your family/social schedule would allow for having to be available 24x7 and have short notice travel you should be ok.   Many older people are going to put their emphasis on wanting to rest and sleep through the night, and be able to make/keep plans with the grandkids.

j5rhm6c,"Great couple of questions! DFIR is absolutely subject to the Dunning-Kruger effect, and you end up with some folks that have seen Cuckoo run once and brand themselves as malware engineers. A SOC analyst being able to reverse engineer malware is not unheard of, but most of the time those are people specialized in that specific skill. There is also a common misunderstanding of what the skills to RE are and when they're truly needed. The skill to truly reverse engineer a piece of malware is still extremely in-depth, and most organizations have no reason to have an RE on staff. So to your question, no it is not an entry or even intermediate-level skill. Folks with true RE skills are also quite expensive. That being said, within the realm of IR specifically, most orgs don't need to know every library leveraged or the nitty-gritty details of every part of a piece of malware. They just generally need to know what it does, if it reaches out to anything,  and grab a hash to block it. There are some incredible sandboxing tools out there nowadays that'll get you most of the way there from an IR perspective, but that is not the same as a deep dive reversing.  IR can be abused and misunderstood certainly. At its core, IR is all about quickly restoring a business to a functional state. So figuring out how they got in and shoring up that hole, identifying and removing any bad guys still in the environment (often beginning with the deployment/review of an EDR solution), and helping the business become operational again by restoring backups, decrypting data, etc etc.  We do see a lot of folks misuse the terms IR, breach, malware engineer, etc., particularly in job postings.

Run an AV like MalwareBytes against the triage too. Start collecting the full image as well. From an analysis standpoint, work through your artifacts looking for weird users or services, known malware like mimikatz or process hacker, look at AV/EDR logs for alerts, check browser history, etc. just work your way down the list.

If it doesn't, you could set a policy that successful tests have > 95% pass rate. * Are the phishing tests intended to address a gap as a result of an actual phish?    * If this is the case, are there any security controls that need to be implemented or adjusted to reduce the amount of phishes that reach inboxes?       * Things like spam filters, number matching MFA, content filtering for newly registered domains, safe links & attachments, etc.    * If these same individuals are high-risk and fail repeatedly, are there any policies that outline the consequences for repeated failures? * Is security awareness training on phishing built into the onboarding training for end users?

An aside - my church is having a speaker this month come in and talk about this very subject more focused on the threats and after effects. it's not just "don't talk to strangers" it's what happens after you talk to the stranger and then meet up IRL? I'll use attendance as a rough gauge to see what the % of parents care enough to take an hour out of their day to increase their understanding. I'm prepared to be disappointed.   Story time. We had an incident at my kids school last month where a stranger attempted to pick up his intended victim by impersonating a relative picking a teenage girl up for a "family emergency." The perp social engineered the school into calling the student up front to be picked up due to family emergency. It came out that this teenage girl shared enough online for the bad actor to sell his story to the school admin, knew all about her family, their names, locations, etc. Fortunately the girl saw the car and the guy inside and said "I have no idea who that is, i'm not going." Cops called, guy bolted before they showed.

I told my professor that there was no fucking way that I would install that shit on bare-metal, and that if he wanted me to use it then I would be doing it through a VM. He was luckily very sympathetic to my concerns, but holyshit, this program is literal spyware and the use of the software introduces some absolutely insane security problems. Not to mention the issues with this particular companies secrecy surrounding their trade secrets and what that means for adequate access to my educational records under FERPA. I did more digging and turns out that my college pays this company a million fucking dollars a year, and of course, none of the people who decided to use the software have any technical literacy at all. Literally all these people care about is user interface colors, and what features the program offers. The students, IT staff, and even most of the professors have been begging the administration to just pay some student employee to proctor tests through Zoom or something, but of course these people just do not give a single shit about any of this. I intend to submit a FERPA request for all of the data that this company has on me, and I guess I'll just have to see how fucked that gets, but holyshit has it been an enlightening window into what my life is going to look like in the near future. All that anyone cares about is money, fuck privacy, fuck security, fuck the educated opinions of professionals that these assholes literally hired to manage this stuff.

If you need time - close time; Set a time in your calendar for proactive focus work.  Excluding emergencies, set meeting at least 24hrs in advance - like all other attendees.  Zero context means bad or non-existent business intelligence - which is crucial just as much as threat intelligence is to provide a good risk-reducing insight for your customers.  If more context is needed - close a time to get it as well; The attitude should be "I care about what you're trying to achieve, help me help you"  &#x200B;  >IT sucks. Tired working with it teams who can’t deliver on their own responsibilities. Too many clueless in gpo, build standards, maintaining assets. Most places ive worked fail the first 2 of sans top 20 but then want a comprehensive security program. The assumption is Cyber can fix all the things without help from other teams. Not true.  Lack of Skill is a cyber risk in and of itself; Shift the priority to solve it first, as it is the bigger risk.  If you know the job better - teach the professional teams how to approach it and solve a specific issue, this is a risk-reducing action, and will help solidify you being a trusted advisor.  Being a trusted advisor - Explain to your customer how and why this is a bigger risk.  &#x200B;  >I cant execute on a cyber program if IT and infrastructure teams are fucking useless.  Very true, see above.  &#x200B;  >I AN NOT THE EXCHANGE ADMIN. HIRE ONE cheap fucks. No dont get a contractor or one from a bullshit VAR. hire one.  Time-consuming false positives are also a cyber risk, as it prevents you from delivering risk-reduction :) This can be solved by a company-wide communication telling people who to turn to.  If they still approach you with this, just say "I'd very much like to help you, here are the exchange admin details"  &#x200B;  >Clueless CIOs and IT directors who dont press their folks to troubleshoot bit instead blame the security tools for most outages or QoS issues.  Directors and team leader saying "this tool created a fault" is a perfectly good lead to investigate, as our security tools shouldn't decrease business availability.  Attending investigative sessions with the vendor AND the professional teams is ALWAYS a good thing.  Either way, once fully investigated, future troubleshooting for a specific issue will be much easier; Once the team leaders knows you work "with them" as a trusted advisor and not against them, it'll make collaborating easier for everyone involved.  &#x200B;  >Fucking SALES people constantly emailing and calling to ask for “time on my calendar” to sell garbage. Fuck you, seriously.  Since they use B2B intelligence, use some as well; true-caller and temporary phone number services are your friends!  In your email, create a garbage folder and block-out entire vendor domains with an inbox rule; It won't stop them entirely, but minimize about 80% of them.  &#x200B;  >Constantly drowning in so much work the concept of tracking lists or work flows totally collapses.  It's okay to be flooded, it means you are needed. sell your skills - not your soul; if you as a professional say the workflow matters - IT MATTERS.  Set a time in your calendar that includes everything you need to investigate and solve a task. postpone the rest.  If the boss asks what's holding other work, show them and be open for priority shifts. If he needs more manpower, that's his task to work on with his bosses, not yours.  &#x200B;  >Orgs who do not take change control seriously, and break shit sending me on a scramble  That's a top cyber risk, many times more critical than the actual "shit that breaks", shift your customer's focus to this risk, instead of the original issue.  &#x200B;  >ZERO accountability for the morons who refuse to skill up and keep bumbling important work.  Collaborate to create correct work flows - that is not considered "doing their job", that is you solving the huge cyber risk called "lack of skill".

I tried to hold on but I couldn’t get shit done without other capable people around .  I left that place for a 500 employee shop but they are a victim of their own success.

CPTS will probably take you longer to get through as it requires the completion of 20-something hands-on modules *before* being allowed to take the exam.

Should you decide to go with it, keep in mind you'll have to use a *lot* of other resources to prepare for the exam as the course content generally isn't enough for students.",EphReborn,1675481782.0,1,t3_10swj0j,10swj0j

If you are doing it to learn, I’d say just get HTB and start tackling away at their modules and machines.  But OSCP is expensive because it has the brand recognition.   I have seen others in previous threads recommending do the HTB CPTS then OSCP, but it sounds like you have a strong foundation and could go for either.   It depends on what path you are trying to go into? What’s your goal? Red team? Pentesting? Sure?

iu475p8,"What's actionable comes down to 3 things:  1) Vote on the changes to the (ISC)2 bylaws When: Voting is open now until 11/19 What: Check out the proposed changes to the bylaws yourself or lean into the analysis posted by one or more trusted colleagues then vote.   If you're on the fence or don't want to deal with it, consider voting "NO" to buy the organization and its members more time to work this out. Voting "YES" pretty much eliminates, the voice of members in any relevant process going forward. This is one time when going with the default is really a vote for a new direction.  2) Sign a petition When: Available now What: The LinkedIn post below has a link to a petition open for action now. It needs 500 member signatures to call a special election on a series of By-Law proposals aimed at making sure this doesn’t happen again. The proposed changes are also posted at the same site as the petition itself.  Unlike the changes proposed by the board, which is a single all or nothing vote without discussion, these proposals provide rationale for why each change is proposed, and it is broken into a number of proposals, so that when it comes to a vote, if there is one that you don't support, but many that you do, you can vote that way.  3) Vote in the Board of Directors election When: Voting will begin Nov. 1 and run until 11/14 What: Consider whether a board of directors that operates in this way regarding members represents you.  At the LinkedIn link below there’s a list of 5 members (and their member numbers) who have agreed to be write in candidates & bring transparency to the board. In the reddit thread there's a link to set a reminder to yourself to take action on this once voting opens on Tuesday of next week, November 1st.  4) Optional: Tell at least one colleague When: any time What: The default is a vote for the board's proposal. Let them know.   Closing remarks: This is an inflection point for (ISC)2. Make no mistake. Ignoring this makes an imprint not likely to reverse.  By focusing on what's actionable we can ratchet down the drama.  https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lindarust_isc2-board-of-directors-election-information-activity-6991419774194892800-M318",Patinish,1666961842.0,2,t3_y79117,y79117

Now I haven't read the books, but I must reiterate, the show based off of them is a literal masterpiece in my opinion. while it might not be cyber security specific, It goes over the concepts of AI, automation, computer science, cyber security, and hacking in a sort of sci-fi/futuristic way that doesn't come off as "Ok this is just unrealistic".

So it’s up to us to decide what we are willing to put up with.   I have several “smart” camera’s in use around the house. In my house i have none. Because i simply can’t trust the data beeing send to the cloud, to be absolutely unhackable. IoT security is a whole new problem on its own.   No device is 100% secure, your smart phone can be hacked just the same as your smart camera. But because the chances of such are lower, we put up with the risk.   So it’s up to you to decide if the risk of your ring camera beeing hacked/abused is worth the convenience of beeing able to see who’s at the front door.   As for me, i have two “zones” i like to think of, public and private. Anything outside the house is public. So i have smart cam’s to watch the gardens, a smart ring at the front door. The idea is that anything in my gardens can be seen by strangers anyway. IN my house i only have a few smart switches to control the lights. I have no smart devices with camera’s or microphones other then my phone, tablet and computer. And i consider these devices reasonably mire secure then most IoT devices, simply because they are of such big company’s that any security problem will be dealth with in a timely fashion.

The summary is that you cannot trust a software completely unless you have written it yourself. And even then, other tools involved in the process like compiler, linker, etc. have to be trustworthy. If not, you cannot trust the executable/binary your own code generates.  Effectively, you have to be able to trust the code, the entire SBOM and equally importantly - the people behind each component of the SBOM, to setup a chain of trust.

iv01znr,"Evaluated both ~10 months ago in a POC. Ended up going with Netskope for a few reasons:  1.	The Zscaler sales team was an absolute nightmare to deal with. They were incredibly pushy, didn’t listen to what we asked, tried going around myself and my boss when we said we were also evaluating Netskope, and then tried to dictate to us what we should/could evaluate in the POC. Getting pricing and even a demo out of them was difficult. The whole experience just left a sour taste in my mouth, and I’m glad I don’t have to deal with them anymore.  2.	I heard some rumors early on that Netskope was no good, but honestly I felt it was the other way around: their SWG and CASB features seemed way better than Zscaler: Netskope allowed us really fine tuned control of user actions and has a huge DB of supported apps. Zscaler’s was pretty limited and it really didn’t seem like they kept it updated (they still had AIM listed as an app to “granularly control”, but no support for apps like TikTok or Discord)  3.	Netskope’s DLP capabilities are also way better than Zscaler’s and we got more DLP features at the same price point with them.  4.	Threat detection wise, they were pretty similar. IIRC, Zscaler missed a few things that Netskope picked up, but Zscaler’s sandbox capability was a bit better overall. Netskope did support forwarding to Wildfire for additional verification, but we never set that up and ended up ditching our sub anyway.  4.	Zscaler’s ZTNA product seemed much better and far more polished than Netskope’s (Netskope’s seemed barebones feature-wise), but Zscaler’s is separate management console.   4.	On the management console side, we had to use 4 different ones for Zscaler. Netskope just has one, and all policies for SWG CASB ZTNA are in the one page/place. Made it really easy to manage everything.  Either way you’ll be happy as overall, they’re both pretty good. If ZTNA is important to you above all else, go Zscaler. If it’s visibility and risk mitigation that’s more important, go Netskope.  My advice: Come up with a list of requirements and POC them both. Don’t let either vendor influence or change this.

Connection to the service takes seconds and is automatic so no users moaning about logging in. ZIA is also a very good product. Zscaler is mature in the market so it got loads of bits that others are missing from their products. With 200 users you are unlikely to get a POC out of them so make sure you grill the SE in a demo.

Like any microsegmentation project, the heavy lift is in the inventory stage. 1) What are the private apps? 2) who needs to access them? 3) Who doesn't need to access them? Application discovery will help, but eventually someone has to define the access policy for each, and every application. Setting up the ZTNA infrastructure isn't hard, rolling out clients isn't hard. For use cases where the application list is small, such as third party access, ZTNA is straightforward. Most providers offer a clientless version for browser-based access, but this will only address specific use cases. If you have client-server applications, look for a ZTNA provider that can support TCP/UDP forwarding. Increasingly, we are seeing prospects ask for ZTNA when they really want to get Internet workloads off of VPN, and the VPN access itself is fine. Try to keep these two concepts separate if that is indeed the case for you. I work for Netskope, but these are my opinions. Cheers",Massive-Double-5152,1667568479.0,2,t3_yl3bqu,yl3bqu

The points of friction I currently see (in no particular order):  * A series of work history gaps * Your current unemployed status * The absence of ongoing professional (re)investment in lieu of relevant work * The tenure at each role being no greater than 6 months * How you're currently framing your existing work experience  Here's my guidance for you, in no particular order:  **1) Consider going back to college for your Bachelors**  This isn't something that's a cure-all (nor is it necessarily feasible, depending on your existing debt and income). However, it would help smooth over a number of the friction points above. Your existing Associates should help with transfer credits (shortening what would otherwise be a 4 year time period to as few as 2). While enrolled as a student, you could be applying to internships, where your existing work history could be more of a *strength* than a *liability*, as most interns lack pertinent work experiences. Upon graduating, you'd essentially be eligible for more new grad roles, with your professional profile slate refreshed like new.  **2) Start at the bottom, again**  By your own admission, you don't really have the technical aptitude or existing work history to be a competitive hire in cyber. Ergo, your applications would likely have a greater likelihood of converting into interviews for entry-level IT work (vs. cybersecurity). However unlikely it may be, it's totally in the realm of possibility that you step back into a work environment that mirrors what you've previously encountered; it's no secret that the lowest levels of IT is a rough place to be. However, if it's your "DREAM" to be in cyber, you need to foster an employment history that reflects that.  The above isn't meant to discourage applying to whichever cyber roles you *do* want; if anything, you should absolutely be applying to your dream roles now. However, in the absence of interviews you may want to consider expanding the aperture of your job hunt to cyber-adjacent positions.  **3) Complement your work history with pertinent certifications**  Employers know that the job market can be really tough. Not everyone is able to work in a relevant cybersecurity role. However, there's little stopping you from reinvesting in your professional aptitude - preferably in the form of pertinent certifications. At worst, having a history of engaged (and completed) trainings/certifications reflects your ongoing commitment to the profession; it likewise reflects the fact that your skills haven't diminished or "rusted".  **4) Re-frame how you will present your previous work to future employers**  Looking from the outside-in with my interviewer hat on, this was concerning to read:  > At best they will think I’m lazy and couldn’t handle the job, at worst they will think I’m lying about how horrible my previous jobs were.  Objectively, when you are being interviewed, the interviewer won't know who you are or what you've been a part of. At most, going into the interview they'll see you've worked a series of 6mo jobs; following that up with consistently bashing each workplace environment isn't great and doesn't help your narrative. Given 3 jobs in 3 different industries (MSP, gov't, finance), the observable constant throughout isn't the workplace - it's you.  So how should you present the experiences and address the hopping?  **Job 1**  "This was my first professional working experience out of college and I was really excited to put into practice what I had learned in my coursework. What I really appreciated was the opportunity to get hands-on experience with a wide variety of tasks, including managing an Active Directory environment and involvement in small-scale incident response events."  **Job 2**  "I had really wanted to work with the federal government leading up through graduation, so I was really excited to have the opportunity emerge so early in my professional career. I was sad to leave my earlier position, but this wasn't an opportunity I felt I could pass up."  **On what followed:**  "While I really appreciated the opportunity to work for the Federal gov't - and I'll always appreciate the people I worked with - there were some personal circumstances needing my attention that required me stepping away from the workforce for a bit."

Another detail that I don't really like to bring up is I made more than double my yearly salary in two weeks during memestock mania.

j1kemvr,"> for others in case they were having trouble parsing your post.  So it just wasn't me.  Thank you!  For starters u/clicklangecho, your resume (even your generic one -- of course you should be modifying your overall resume based on the job req you're applying to) should be relevant to the industry.  Not sure your series 6 stuff for example translates.  It's impressive that you got that but I quite honestly don't care if I'm counting you on keeping my company or my clients safe.  2, Ummm, I think your communication skills could be holding you back.  Good lord there was so much to wade through in that post I don't know where to start to begin to offer you advice.  Also, by definition, the tl;dr goes up FRONT and is NOT supposed to be as long at the post.  3, Regarding your resume, try the google style (https://www.inc.com/bill-murphy-jr/google-recruiters-say-these-5-resume-tips-including-x-y-z-formula-will-improve-your-odds-of-getting-hired-at-google.html).

j1invby,"Thank you for this excellent post. Not necessarily what I wanted to hear but I appreciate the blunt honesty. There are a few more pieces of supplemental information in regard to the brief time spent on jobs and potential ways to address.  1. I underestimated the time spent in positions, actual time is closer to 7-8 months in each position.  Still not great, but better than 6 across the board 2. 30-day gap between cloud MSP and that contractor job. I don't care what experience or work history the hypothetical hiring manager has, they are incompetent if they think one analyst fielding three remote desktop connections with three different clients with three different issues, talking on the phone with one and chatting with the other two, is a good idea and the basic expectation for new hires. This was an everyday experience, and the federal department got to handle all of the fallout from the mistakes people made from working on multiple issues simultaneously, which were plentiful and cost significant manhours to remediate. If the manager thinks it's not a big deal I will ask for an immediate demonstration of them doing three different interviews at the same time in a similar context. I am prepared to die on that hill. 3. This is the part that I am unsure of how to bring up. During my last few weeks as a contractor, I made over double my yearly salary in a span of two weeks during the memestock craze. This provided the financial cushion for me to take time off (10months) and sparked my interest in finance. For the entire 10 months, I was self-studying the finance industry and building up the knowledge that allowed me to succeed when I got into the license training program with a 65% percent washout rate mostly amongst people with 4-year finance degrees. I passed each registration exam on the first attempt, I would have been fired immediately if I failed any single one. Furthermore, there is a LARGE overlap of necessary soft skills between cybersecurity and finance mostly consisting of risk identification, management, risk identification, and being able to analyze abstract and incomplete information sets in order to come to a decision that maximizes the balance between risk and reward. Also just handling so much PII, both industries train extensively for fraud identification as well. Although this position was outside of cyber, there are enough parallels to make it relevant. 4. That brings me to what will become 4 months of unemployment in January. I spent most of this time, until the last week or so really, applying and getting consistent interviews for careers I wanted to explore that were IT or Finance adjacent. These positions were along the lines of physical security system installations like IP camera networks. After quite a bit of research and interviews, I came to the conclusion that all of my favorite parts of these careers were just IT, so I should just give that another shot. Once the second week of January hits, I will be sending out my first applications to cyber jobs and see where I stand in terms of competitive skills.   Also for your other suggestions, I got the Security+ entirely via self-study, it wasn't part of the program or necessary for graduation. I also have experience competing in CTF events with my old IT club, which got 2nd place in a state-wide competition I participated in. Most of us graduated after but we trained up the others who placed 1st the next year. We humiliated an extensive number of 4-year degree teams in the process.",clicklangecho,1671904439.0,0,t1_j1i2zjo,zu6td1

j1jisbt,"It’s not fun to admit but I had a pretty turbulent life early on, dropped out of highschool at 16 with some non-violent felonies and a 0.01 gpa from missing every single class freshman-sophomore year. I was around 20 by the time I even considered the possibility that I could do more in life. I had to learn how to be a student from the ground up and develop every single good habit from scratch. Slowly started taking remedial highschool classes and passed my first algebra class at age 22. I finally got to the point where I could pursue an actual degree and I knew I liked computers so I set up a meeting with the IT director. He hooked me up with the program and the rest is history. I would have graduated with a 3.9 if I didn’t fail my first few attempts at remedial classes in the beginning. Later I found out my record qualified for expungement so technically it’s like it never happened but I’ve been upfront about it in all my background checks. I guess long story short is I’m not worried about the poly test itself, I’m just confident that any job that requires one to begin with would not be interested in me whatsoever. A lot of the jobs near me that want SC eventually want you to get TS/SCI but I’ll definitely keep that in mind because I should be able to get it based on that criteria.   And honestly, I checked out that contractor’s indeed page and they drastically bumped up the pay and removed the basic Tier 1 stuff from the job description. It’s an actual tier 2 position now and that generally means more time off the phones.

With a technical background you may understand some managerial concepts better/easier but IMO the GSLC is not overtly technical.   Along with the training there is a scenario simulation you go through called Cyber42. This is meant for you to apply what you are learning and helps instill the mindset you should have as a cybersecurity leader.   Very approachable without a tech background. And if you take your time to go through the videos, make notes, revise, take quizzes, re-read books, and make an index you will learn a lot and have a wealth of resources to pull from as you take on the new role. It also makes the test much easier.   If your employer is paying and is ok with you being certified in 4 months - go for it!",Airdale_60T,1673622213.0,2,t3_10at31r,10at31r

iwtdpjm,"I like your reasoning and often summarizes it as: ***follow the problem instead of the acronyms***. Here is an extract of our corporate blog titled: ***They Call It XDR. We Call It Continuous Compromise Assessment*** that may add value to this conversation  Provide the Best Solution for the (Correct) Problem     First-principles thinking is a mental model that allows you to innovate in leaps, rather than increments (famously championed by Elon Musk). The first step is to focus on your problem and that you are indeed solving the correct problem. We often waste energy by trying to solve the wrong problem. It’s easier—but lazier— for us to think in terms of analogies, basing problems on things we are familiar with or assumptions we are comfortable with. EDR and XDR were both developed taking into account the weaknesses of their predecessors. That’s why they’re typically defined as an analogy: ‘it’s like X, but better.’ Instead, we challenged our assumptions and asked the hard questions that lead to better innovation.      Vendors are also prone to misapplying new technologies because of this misdiagnosis. We’ve seen powerful new AI techniques being developed only to be misapplied. As pointed out by Joseph Blankenship from Forrester at a recent discussion, vendors started saying to themselves “We’re pretty good at big data now, so let’s turn security into a big data problem,” with disastrous results.      So what is the ‘correct’ problem? It’s not that SIEM isn’t doing enough. The problem isn’t EDR, NDR, XDR, or any other acronym, for that matter. ***The problem is that catastrophic compromises occur with unacceptable frequency because the adversary remains undetected in the network for too long.***  This problem hasn’t changed much—apart from getting worse—through various iterations of security tools built upon their flawed foundations",rvilladiego,1668747661.0,8,t3_yy10pt,yy10pt

ixdm4f9,"A rose by any other name. Remember the old cliché cherchez la femme (problème?). If not, you are "fire, ready, aim". SIEM originated decades ago in a world where centralized logging lagged decentralized network assets. An Ops problem originally which later morphed to a Compliance solution. From there to doing something security related (Log mgmt is not SIEM) coz it was needed.      Today's problem? Faster attack detection and if possible, fast auto response. The Detect & Response side of the (inevitable) breach. As a result of its central position in log collection from assets around the network, SIEM has been traditionally used to assist the detection function. Along comes XDR (evolving from its EDR parent) adding auto response to detection to the wide palette of assets which now routinely include SaaS, public cloud, API and people (behaving badly?) to the traditional desktop, server, network devices and the need for "X" is revealed. X for detection and X for response and so XDR.      So is SIEM dead? Yes (the <2015 definition) and No (the >2022 definition) which considerably broadens detection. SIEM technology vendors are continuously evolving and it remains viable as an attack detector but if and only if you have self-serve capability (skillz and $$$s). Else a managed service (using SIEM technology somewhere underneath) is your route to problem solving.

Meanwhile you go out into the community and see people saying the average dwell time is 100-200+ days.  Fundamentally, our attitudes on detection are broken because our marketing mentality is based on a world of slow-moving APT groups looking for country-level data, rather than crime groups who are looking for a smash and grab.  XDR and SIEM are marketed as a visibility tool, but most orgs are so badly tuned that you’re just looking at a cloudy data pond rather than a crystal clear data lake.

The data we have , time and time again,  shows that the network was compromise long before the ransomware piece started to encrypt (90 to 180 days in average). Yet the security team more often than not, ignored those small signs that give them the upper hand to defend the organization better.

What you may not have realized is that the interview started when the whole "get 2 PCs so we can do this" started. How you choose to react to a situation that involves things you didn't prepare for is often very telling. For example, I have learned that when an org asks you to do something while you're working on something else, it's appropriate to ask what the priority is of the new thing. Should I switch tasks? Split my time? Add this new one to the queue? I can say with 100% certainty that the org does not want you to increase your stress level spinning cycles trying to figure out how to accomplish twice the work in the same time.  They may have been looking for someone who encounters a scenario that is less than ideal and assumes they can accomplish it, or at least try. The world has a lot of people who get upset when asked to do something in less than ideal situations. People leave for new employers when these "less than ideal" situations shift from occasional to frequent.   It's clear that the situation bothered you, you found it stressful to setup two PCs, which is clearly an unreasonable situation to interview in, and you talked about rescheduling it. Could you have accomplished the zoom interview and the game on a single PC, without it being a stressful situation? Could you have played the game and laughed at your own mistakes?

I have never been to the Netherlands and don't know much but I've heard it's quite a beautiful place to live and it ranks way higher than all of the USA in the happiness index.  As someone who lives in the USA I will say it's not the perfect dreamland you may have imagined, and that's okay because nowhere is-  but lets get realistic.  The places you would probably want to live (New York, Seattle, Silicon Valley) are all very very expensive and your living situation would probably not be much better than what it is now even with a crazy good tech salary, it may even be worse.  I know people who live in the Bay Area and make 200K+ a year and they still live in tiny studios or with roommates.  Workers rights here are also non-existent, if I am understood the Netherlands gives like a minimum of 4 weeks of paid vacation, very generous paternity and maternity leave, etc...

There is also stuff like lack of public transportation, subpar and expensive healthcare, etc..  I don't hate the USA but there is a lot that could be better here.  I'm also almost 30 myself with a CISSP and honestly I've been burned out by corporate America.  I no longer am the bright-eyed bushy-tailed 20 year old that believes hard work and grinding pay off.

I've been through some of the material and it'll be a significant lift, but I've dealt with enough audits from the other side of the table I'm not overly worried about it. There are some ethics bits with audit that are hard to grok if you're usually the 'doer' guy (mostly revolving around what you can offer as to mitigations) but they're not too hard once you grok what the role is for (I'm not here to fix it, I'm here to tell YOU what to fix).  CISSP I did a bootcamp and pounded the book for a month, but the bootcamp was probably unnecessary. My understanding is the CISA isn't that hard.  If you do go into audit, just don't be, 'The guy who comes in after the fight's over to knife the wounded.' You won't get next years audit work if you're external and you'll be actively subverted if you're internal.   That's not to say don't do the job correctly, but from my perspective 90% of the benefit of the auditor is the work we do to prep for the audit (and finding all the crap we did wrong, then using the audit as leverage to tell product/etc to fuck off for a month so we can actually fix it) and then having someone come in to check our work.

If you are at the CISO level, this could include being sued personally in addition to being let go post security incident.)  Back to your question...   When ever I go to a new company, I typically update the user awareness training to include the following:  * Security Awareness Training is to be completed with in the first 10 business days of the hire date, and annually thereafter. * Failure of Phishing tests:    * 1st failure in a 12 month period - User gets and email from the security team.    * 2nd failure in a 12 month period - Employee's manager and the {insert appropriate Security leader title here} meet with Employee to review and the employee is required to re take the security awareness training. (If the employee fails to complete the SAT within X days, their network access will be suspended until accommodations to complete training are arranged with the Security Team.)    * If an employee fails three or more phishing tests in a 24 month period, the employee is to received a written reprimand and meets with HR to discuss remediation plan.

In smaller shops (<300 people) there's a lot more manual work done across all departments. They don't have the budget to hire, train, and retain the staff with the experience to automate large swaths of their business, and that's assuming they can afford the enterprise licenses for some of the offerings. Your value in a place like this might be more focused on your ability to gain deep knowledge about how the whole environment is structured and then do manual review of a subset of items. Programming may or may not be a focus, or even used for these types of orgs in their day to day.  Contrast that with a larger org like any of the FAANG++ companies, or your example of a healthcare project - things that are impossible to do without scaling of some kind. Your value here would be more dependent on programming ability, even if it's only to be able to parse code someone else has written. These opportunities are also going to be the ones that pay a lot more, so if money is something you're chasing (and there's nothing wrong with that) then you need to be ready to move into programming and development to meet those expectations.  Overall your entire post is aimed at someone going for the top level, high earning potential roles at place like FAANG++ companies, but there's lower tier ones as well that don't have such stringent requirements.  >Like it or not, within 5 years, if you can't write code, you likely will not be in the industry at all.

iawz1mg,"I've been mulling over this for a minute and finally figured I'd write some kind of response.   So, in short, I kind of agree with the sentiments OP is giving, but I don't necessarily agree with the fleshed out explanations they've given.   One thing I'd caution is the use of fallacies in some of your examples. Specifically the last one and more specifically this part:     >I think there's a mindset in InfoSec that you can be a odd ball and do great. Maybe some companies, but I've probably worked and consulted for 100 of the top 500 companies in the US, and do you know how many blue haired people or mohawks I've seen? Zero...  Just because you haven't seen it, doesn't mean it isn't there. Also, the point about having worked for 100 of the top 500 companies is not a meaningful quantifier or qualifier.  Please be cautious of this when trying to help people.  &#x200B;  I guess the easiest way to respond is to list the points by number and just reply, so I'll do that:  PREFACE: I'm not attempting to start an argument, I'm just replying and giving my take. Not discrediting OP, just giving my two cents and advice on some of the points.  1) I mostly agree with this. Understanding Windows AND Linux is important. And you need more than just a cursory understanding for a lot of roles.   The problem kind of comes in the 2nd and 3rd paragraphs where you mention setting up servers in the cloud and then go on to declare a certification as trash. Cloud is expensive. Not everyone can afford to just standup servers in the cloud for testing. Perhaps also consider using virtual machines. As far as the Lin+ cert, yeah it's not the best, but it's also not that bad. Especially for getting your feet wet and getting some knowledge. Are there better certs out there? Absolutely. Do you NEED a Linux, or even Windows, cert to make it in security? No, not really.  2) I'm biased on this one, I'll admit. I personally use Python for a lot, I use C++ for a decent bit, and I have a working knowledge of Powershell and various other languages. I use them for more than just automation though. Honestly, a lot of the automation side of things isn't even assigned to the security team at my company, it's assigned to development teams. I heavily disagree with the statement that if you can't write code you won't be in the industry in 5 years. You yourself said in a later point that there are so many types of jobs in security, surely you also agree that there are plenty of jobs that don't require you to know how to code.  3) I pretty much agree with this one without much issue. I work in Incident Response and am currently building out the Threat Intel and Threat Hunting Team at the company I work for and will be managing that team once it is fully fleshed out. Pentester and SOC have just become the "golden boy" roles that everyone wants because it's largely the only roles that are widely advertised in media and such.  4) This one is a mixed bag. I personally feel that you should keep up with current trends and threats, but I'm also biased because I work in IR and am moving to CTI/Threat Hunt, so keeping up on things is literally part of my job. That's not to say that every person needs to spend countless hours reading daily to keep up with everything that's going on. At least spend a little time each week learning about current things that affect YOUR role and environment, beyond that, do what you want.   I also don't see your explanation as having much to do with passion projects. I also fervently disagree that a passion project has to be related to security. Having a security job and then focusing on security during your free time is a good way to burn out. If you're passionate about woodworking, do that. Your passion project should be something that you are passionate about, not just something field related. A good hiring manager or whatever wants to know what interests you as a person have, outside of the field. That makes you well rounded.  5) Understanding a product is fine but due to how expensive those products are, it's pretty infeasible to advise people to understand them before joining a company. It's great that you spend 10k training someone before putting them on a project, but what about training them on the job? What about training them in other areas? I don't see the point in hiring someone and then immediately pigeon holing them. I also feel that the "most companies have trash training budgets" is an unfounded statement and is based on personal experience with no actual data. But that's just a gripe and not really a point I'm making so I'll leave it there.  6) Honestly, I'd take the 70k offer. It's cool that a company would offer me a 10k training budget, but what's to say I actually get to use that budget for what I want? Does the company decide what courses or platforms I should take training on or do I? There are too many variables in your example that leave unanswered questions. I could take the 70k offer, use what extra money I have to buy courses on like Udemy, buy books, self study, etc and utilize free training and still make 100k in 3 years. A training budget isn't really a panacea.  7) Also a mixed bag. I get that some companies want the trim, cut, and polished look of the olden days, but that's a pretty archaic view and is slowly falling by the wayside.   I do agree that it is common courtesy to turn your video on if the other party has it on. That's an unarguable point. But the point about "most hiring managers will judge you on how you present yourself in an interview" is a bit loaded. You're basically admitting that you're fine judging a book by its cover and that you don't take into account much else.  &#x200B;  All in all, you had some good points, but a lot of them need more fleshing out or a revision.",ItzKale,1654180096.0,1,t3_v2ziwo,v2ziwo

iaw4nar,"This is one of the most unfair things about IT in general. This expectation that you need to be an expert on every vendor under the sun. If you have good fundamentals, a good attitude, and a willingness to learn, that is all I'm looking for in my employees. If I am reading between the lines, that is kind of the point the main poster is making. Get that foundational knowledge first in some form with at least 1 vendor. You will have to pass some level of technical questioning during the interview process.  During the technical interview I want you to get the technical questions close to right. I don't want people guessing either. If you don't know the answer or the vendor, say so and mention how you would find the answer, or how you would solve the problem using another vendors platform you are familiar with. What I'm really looking for in an interview is how you present yourself. I want staff that I can put in front of a customer, and still have that customer after.   3 Tips I would make to anyone coming into that interview room.  1. Know the company. At the very least do a bit of research on the companies history. If it is a remote interview like many these days, have some notes on the company ready. 2. Look presentable. If it is a remote interview, clean your damn room. Make sure the lighting is good. Just put in some level of effort that shows me that you aren't going to be a liability if you need to talk to a customer. If your passion is collecting Star Wars toys, setup in front of your Star Wars collection. Bookshelves are always a safe bet (as long as it isn't full of hentai).  3. Be a human being. I know you are nervous. I know the real reason you want the job is because you have to eat, not because of whatever bullshit line you are going to feed me about lifelong passion to read log files. If you are in the interview, it is because I'm already fairly certain about your skillset. I'm looking almost exclusively here for organizational fit and attitude.

iwn0mii,"MSPs can be complete pieces of shit.  Their salespeople use programs like "Network Detective" that they run on a potential client's system and return a full report that is impossible to get a good score on with a bunch of shit that doesn't matter making it "fail/at risk", in that program's documentation there is then instructions on how to set up "exclusions" after the sale is made and they take over to make things conveniently look better.  Their RMM suites punch through all your security and give nt authority/system level access straight to india.  These suites usually break the things they claim to "manage" - usually patching is completely fucked after these things take over, especially Windows feature updates and third party software (but you get pretty graphs, don't you like graphs?)  They will lie in a heartbeat - their whole job it to do the IT work for a company that doesn't know anything about, or more importantly doesn't CARE about IT.  To expect ANYTHING to be done properly security-wise is a fantasy.  There are plenty of former IT and Telcom sales assholes that go out there, start a business, hire some rejects to work a help desk, buy some RMM licenses. and sell this bullshit "package" to some suckers.  The company that hired them thinks they have everything taken care of, which is almost always entirely wrong.  "They're on top if it, we never had to reset our passwords at 90 days before, now we do, they're doing a great job"  The bad news is, management usually will look at you like you shat in their face if you try to explain to them any of this.

iwnkkma,"Welcome to the world of working with MSPs. Pretty much with all of the MSPs I've worked with in the past, the starting point has been all over the place as far as how much security was considered in the implementations. Sometimes they consider security from the very beginning, in which case it's not bad....others I have worked with have been liabilities that we needed to reset expectations with or move on from.   It is an issue, and the fact that they were able to whip up RBAC pretty quickly means they recognized it was indeed an issue. As the IT PM, you're probably the internal champion your org needs to keep the MSP in line.   My recommendations would be to pick your battles carefully and then go all in on them. Create a list of weaknesses or items that need remediation -> prioritize that list -> get support from your internal side -> then take that to the MSP with their support on what needs to be addressed & when. Sometimes they improve, sometimes they don't (in which case you drop them)",OtheDreamer,1668641186.0,1,t3_yx3pod,yx3pod
iwoo8v3,"At the very least, make sure they're using a supported version of QuickBooks. No longer available as one time purchases, the 2021 versions and newer are subscription-only.  Intuit has improved security with these newer versions. At my CPA firm, we *used* to be able to “break“ into our own backups by entering in our product key and serial number which would allow us to reset the admin user account. Not anymore though. Now, Intuit requires an Intuit account for the Admin owner for every company file and doesn't allow resetting Admin access until the Admin user permits it. If the admin user is no longer available then they make you prove your rights to the privileged access with their account protection team by sending them photo ID, partnership agreement, LLC formation docs, etc. [Intuit KB requesting primary admin contact](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/primary-administrator/request-primary-admin-contact/L2P0XAUIT_US_en_US) i.e. Intuit takes security pretty seriously now. Depending on whether your company file has sensitive data (PII, credit card numbers) some of the security controls (mandatory passwords, password complexity) will kick on automatically and cannot be turned off. As far as risk management goes with QuickBooks especially, you're more likely to experience a negative event due to internal threats.   There was a string of threats circulating a couple years ago targeting CPA firms, accountants and bookkeepers where a macro enabled Word file would spawn a PowerShell script and look for those QuickBooks files so it could exfiltrate them to a Google drive or Dropbox. Plain ole user awareness and training can help with this type of phishing and social engineering attack.  At least you got those security groups created. Now it can't be accessed by every authenticated user on the domain. 👍 Even then, verify those file share permissions quarterly, QuickBooks has a fundamental flaw: When an administrator runs a "repair" on the QuickBooks database after a system crash using QuickBooks own file doctor tool, all the file-share permissions can be reset, bringing back that Everyone group on the file share.",OPujik,1668660630.0,1,t3_yx3pod,yx3pod

We were in a meeting with an MDR vendor and my boss asks him what his favorite penetration testing app was.  He wanted an app he could install on a workstation, hit go and then it would spit out a report he could charge big money for.  Again, this is in a meeting with an MDR vendor who only sells MDR.

I mean we can read about latest CVEs, data breaches but are there any good repositories which have year wise happenings in cyber which we can reffer to. Apart from reading what else is suggested?  2. What are your thoughts on Certifications? When i see job posting (even for freshers) there is a lot of emphasis on Certifications, whereas it's completely different for developer roles (certification is not mentioned for most roles for freshers)  3. How does a CTO's day look like? I believe there will be a lot of meetings.  4. How necessary is you think the shift left policy in cyber? With DevSecOps being the new normal now, how do you think the cyber landscape will evolve? Will there be any decrease in attacks?  Thanks 😊",aayushku01,1650557241.0,5,t3_u8pgcc,u8pgcc

You're not weird because it stings and is uncomfortable. But think of it pragmatically, so they say no. Who cares? No one else will ever know. They're not going to start a subreddit dedicated to making fun of you for asking. They will probably be flattered that you did ask.

What that meant is I was there to make sure the bosses were able to understand what the technology was and how it could be used within our day-to-day activities. Pretty thankless job if you're wondering. But I also rubbed elbows with **many** C-suite from the IT side in various other roles I've held -- to include a federal public sector entity.  **What my question was attempting to boil down to: Dr. Blumofe, is as a person who is a C-Suite himself....how/why does he perceive cybersecurity not taken seriously at the C-Suite level?**  I've been in many meetings where the entire reason a cyber security program, or headcount, was allocated was to ensure the "checkbox" was annotated before a specific audit was to performed for regulatory or compliance. Many of the tools are not tuned correctly. Training is not performed with staff to ensure they know how to operate it (let alone patch it). Not to mention there is never a direct push by many companies at the CEO level on the importance of cybersecurity. It typically comes from the "C-Suite" IT person -- who typically is the CTO/CIO or potentially just the President/COO even. When you look purely at the definitions of what a CTO/CIO is charged with, it is to keep IT going and to keep Employees/Customers happy in order to make money. IT is considered a revenue buster by many companies, and thus, these C-suite tend to feel more heat if they start to prevent the Sales/Ops/Engineers from churning the revenue generator wheel. Thus, cybersecurity typically is the thing that gets waterboarded at meetings.   "Why do we need MFA? That just slows down sales from doing their job if they need it for Salesforce!"   "Can't passwords only be 10 characters long and not reset until 180 days? People hate changing it so often, and we don't want them writing their pw's down in paper!"   "Why do we need to buy password managers for everyone? Can't they just use a word document and password protect it?"   "I don't understand why you need more than ONE firewall!"   "How much is this Splunk tool? And why do you need it?"   These are all legit questions I've heard from various CISO's and CIO's over the last 10 years. The MFA one is the #1 thing that burned most of them during these very informal chats. These are folks that if you looked up their backgrounds, are MBA and CPA's by trade. Some will have their CISSP, but when you look at what it takes to be a CPA alone, you understand why that credential means more to them than the CISSP would ever. Not to mention it is a test. These are folks who most likely have **never** worked a day in their SOC Analysts chairs to see what it is like to get the tickets in and not have the resources to do their job. They haven't worked with their penetration testing team to understand the pushback they get when they try to test a specific department's network infrastructure for vulnerabilities and to report back findings.",bigt252002,1650595029.0,6,t1_i5ogqhh,u8pgcc

i5pqm59,"I'll offer an answer: it's not that everyone doesn't "get it", it's just not the right business decision to spend more on security than absolutely necessary. Which for most people in a security related career is a fundamentally unacceptable level leading to the assumption "they seem smart - they must just not get it".  It's like the fact everyone knowing the world continues to head towards terrible consequences due to fossil fuel use, while carrying on producing millions of inefficient consumer vehicles every year and allowing industry to do almost whatever they want in the name of consumerism. Because there are no real consequences, "doing the right thing" would make you lose some competitive advantage. "Don't look up" could just as much be a parody about how people deal with security concerns.  Best example of why people don't really see value in security investment is Equifax. That should by some accounts have been an Enron and Arthur Andersen example to the world due to complete rampant disregard for documented processes. Instead it was swept under the rug "let the government sanctioned monopoly continue!" because "it's not their fault, someone hacked them!". Equifax is doing better than ever, with a significantly increased cyber security budget. Every other company looks at examples like that and says "ok - so I don't aggregate nearly as much, or as sensitive PII, and they just had to apologize and patch things up after being hacked - why am I going to spend more money up front?"  SolarWinds took a brand hit, but they just keep ticking along as a company currently at $2 billion market cap. You can have a MSP business model, a hack like that with scale like that, and the market assumes you'll just come back from it. Sure you'll lose some value, so everyone has a security budget to do the basic stuff since that's worth it - but to really spend to cover off all known risks? No thanks, we'll take our chances just like everyone else because even if we're unlucky and get hacked, it's not like anyone is losing their job. Oh, except whoever is unlucky enough to be responsible for security at the time, clearly it was their fault and we need new leadership there, the customers and market expect that much.",SomeoneNicer,1650604979.0,3,t1_i5pc5bh,u8pgcc

i5p36a9,"I'm a cybersec engineer working in the utility/grid space.  There IS technology to enforce the concepts behind zero trust in OT networks, and it's fairly unique to OT for the reasons you brought up.   First, it has to be implemented at layer 2 or lower--segmentation at the firewall/router level is useless when you're talking modbus across an ERPS network, nevermind if you're implementing automated protection schemes where metering is every 6ms and communications is sub 16ms for an entire control/command.  Second is the type of traffic. Same as before, you have low latency, real-time, zero-jitter requirements...you cannot introduce the traditional model zero-trust controls with latency/overhead from CPU processing and stuff like vpn encryption.  The only product I'm personally familiar with that implements it "right" is [SEL's SDN product](https://selinc.com/solutions/ot-sdn/). They validate the device, no traffic by default, individual flows must be added on a case by case basis, and it doesn't introduce latency or overhead that could impact grid controls. There is a other competitor in this space that makes a good product, the company starts with a T but I can't remember it...anyway, most of the zero trust market has some catching up to do, and most industrial-focused solutions out there try to solve the OT problems with IT solutions, which don't always work.",admiralspark,1650592516.0,2,t1_i5nkxb9,u8pgcc

i87us9i,"Cybersec analyst here. The reality is that the answer to most peoples' questions about jobs and careers here is "it depends".  It depends on geographic location, size of company, and industry the company is in. FAANG companies in SF Bay area? They're probably looking for someone more aligned with a SWE background than one in IT. Lots more AppSec jobs than other types of security roles available.  It depends on how the security team is structured and whether they have sub-teams or not. A small company with just one security team is probably looking to have some diversity within that team (mix of IT, DevOps, SWE, etc.) whereas a larger security business unit might have delineated teams for engineering, analysts, threat research, internal applications, network security. Those teams would be more specific in their requirements for who they're looking to hire.  The security industry is also in a constant state of flux - new specialties have popped into existence the last few years that wouldn't have been a specific role previously - and recruiting is a general problem for any tech role.   Right now I've applying to SecEng positions and running into all of the above.

I think it serves as a reflection of the issue with cyber security. There's a shortage and companies need people, yet few want to invest in people to train a workforce and instead want to keep hunting for unicorns that can be plug-and-play. Degrees are talked down as not relevant, yet what can be done as every organization's network and security needs are different? I feel like my degree provided a great security baseline that helped me get into my current role. Then we have others who talk down certs and say they just show memorization ability, yet what are other ways to demonstrate understanding of fundamental material? Plus there are others who say you can't get into cyber unless you have 5-10 years of regular IT experience, yet we have people getting SOC and other security roles with 0 years experience and doing well. I think to solve the worker shortage it's going to take a cultural shift of being willing to train people instead of outsourcing the training to employees, industries pairing with universities to develop better curriculum, and true entry level security feeder positions being offered to truly entry-level people.",mckeitherson,1652293831.0,22,t3_unf6lb,unf6lb

i8abqxe,"I am still a nooblet and only have a few years under my belt, but I think my story is somewhat unusual and I feel unbelievably lucky to be where I am today. I'd love to tell ya'll how I got 'in' if you can bare the Wall of text ahead!  I'm a Security Engineer at an MSP. In my early 20's I ended up working first for IT resellers, then at Dell as a sales bro for a few years. I grew to hate Sales and even though the pay was good (for my age and education) I felt like I was losing my 'self' and had no real passion for the job other than a love of technology (and the desire to continue paying rent and eating).   After a few years of selling AppAssure (I Know, I know, I'm sorry!) I left and ended up at SolarWinds as a Sales Engineer. I also earned my degree from that shithole ITT tech in the evenings during this period. I was woefully unprepared for the level of technical chops required for the SE role and lacked any training or mentorship for the year I was there. My degree was about as useful as a screen-door on a submarine. I eventually became super depressed and after hearing that I was looking to find technical work, a friend of mine offered to put in a word for me with his company's owner. Owner calls me and we chatted for a while. I was 100% honest about what I did and did not know, to the best of my ability. I did Not want to misrepresent myself in any way! He liked me, even with my lack of technical experience, and promised that he'd find me a spot when he could afford it. It took a few weeks and I had to work up the nerve to call this CEO back first, but I sacked up and called him again. He had time to talk and he told me "we're having a LAN party this Friday. Do you like PC gaming? Why don't you come meet the team and see if its a good fit?" I accepted the invite and low and behold, It was a good fit. I officially interviewed soon after and they offered me the position a few days after that.  I got in as an L1 helpdesk technician (took a big risk and gave up over 20K of salary not including commission) and was EXTREMELY fortunate to find a mentor in a talented and hard-working senior tech; this guy basically inspired me to succeed. Because of my personality and customer-facing experience I was made the (only) Onsite Support Specialist for the org and experienced many adventures and challenges because of that role. I dual-roled as a regular tech / Onsite Specialist but I spent the majority of my time travelling to customer sites doing all sorts of different work.   I risked everything to be there and that motivated me to work my ass off constantly. When I tell you I put my best foot forward more than ever in my life, I Mean it. I grabbed the Comptia trifecta and took any free courses for Azure, 365, Security, etc that I could get my hands on. I strove to make a difference every. single. day. Every opportunity to volunteer for after-hours datacenter work, circuit turn-ups, or emergency assists, I made sure I offered myself up. It was hard and it took time, but it all kind of supercharged my growth. The more I took on, the more they trusted me with harder and more interesting tasks.   After a couple years in that role, I competed with several other colleagues for a Jr. Security Engineer role in our newly formed Security Operations Department. I interviewed with a manager and a director and a few days later, I got the gig.   I got my (shitty) degree in Cyber Security from ITT. I had Always wanted it, from the beginning of my career. I let other things cloud my path and I had a lot of learning to do before I hit my stride; I regret nothing about that. But I figure I have a lot of ground to cover and at 32 I'm not getting any younger! I still put forth maximum effort all the time. My manager often jokes that I "care too much" and I could not be more proud of receiving that jibe.   That's how I 'got into Cyber'. I'm sure some of the greybeards here can probably pinpoint how I actually got so lucky, but in my mind.. I worked hard af and earned it. I encourage anyone reading this that are still trying to 'get in', to never give up. Strive to make a difference with ANYTHING you put your hand to. Be a "try-hard", seek out challenges, and don't be afraid to fail! Leaders will notice this drive and ,in my opinion, it breeds excellence in others around you.

I am currently work for a vendor as a senior technical account manager where I help customers get the most out of our product, mainly by helping them identify and implement the different use cases that we can help solve.  Here is a quick rundown of my path to where I'm at:  Undergrad - Information Technology with an emphasis in security (basically there were about 3 courses specific to security and a requirement to take multiple courses from other areas, networking, DBA, OS, etc).   Graduated, started working as a field service tech, nothing related to security.  Switched jobs and became the system admin for a small credit union.  From there I was hired by a SIEM company to write regular expression rules, all day, every day, regex all the time. Ooof.  During that time I did an online Masters degree in Information Security and assurance.  Once I graduated and worked my degree payments off (one of those "work for us a year and you won't have to pay us back" things) I left the SIEM company and started working for a small/medium sized retail company as a Cybersecurity engineer. Basically in the interview they were like "you know what SIEM means? great! manage our SIEM"   For that position, I think the masters degree and the SIEM knowledge got me the role there.  While I was there I worked and earned my CISSP.     From that spot I went and switched teams and was hired by the SIEM vendor (different from the previous SIEM vendor) as a professional service consultant. Basically we performed the technical tasks that customers either didn't want to or didn't know how to do themselves. I would write scripts, DB queries, custom log rules, etc.   Because I had my CISSP, I was placed on a lot of accounts who needed an "advisor" to help them workout their priorities.  I was then promoted to Technical Account Manager at that same SIEM company, where I helped guide my customers on use cases, implementations, etc.  I left that job to land where I'm at now.  Next steps in the future I'm thinking a principle or architect role.  That was a very brief description though, hopefully it makes sense haha.",belkmaster5000,1652305936.0,1,t3_unf6lb,unf6lb

I worked at a Fortune 5 high-tech company, a government contractor, the #2 student loan guarantor, and now at the nation’s fourth best hospital that is also a teaching hospital, research center, and a level 1 trauma center. I’ve done a little of everything including project management, policy, being a CISO and privacy officer, IS compliance, and risk assessments. I’ve had to hire people.   First off, certs don’t mean a thing except they can show you are actually “raising the bar” and continuing to learn.   My manager mentor taught me one thing when hiring. You can pretty much teach any one anything except not to be an asshole. Security is very much a team job and, if you don’t fit in, you’re worthless.   There really are two paths. A tech path and then more of a business path. For the tech path, I just don’t want a warm body. I want someone with passion genuinely interested. Someone that reads Krebs, keeps up on Twitter, etc. I can smell someone in it for the money. They won’t get a second interview. A SANS, CEH, or even Security+ is nice here to distinguish you from other candidates.   For a biz position, I look for drive and a sense of wanting to improve. Someone that is humble and can energize people. Outgoing and wants to share their knowledge. Not a really smart security person who only speaks in tech terms and won’t shut up to let people get a word in edgewise. A listener. This is harder for an entry-level person to get in. A SANS, CISSP, CISM, CISA, or PMP cert is nice here.

i8bxtwu,"I do think you bring up a valid point I joined this thread recently and have noticed there is a decent amount related to job searching in the field  Personally I'm the Director of Security at a relatively large company and I try to make most of the position on our security team truly entry level. I hire people mostly met from personal networking with no experience and who are usually finishing a degree or have a cert or two. Typically I look for personal traits to determine if they would make a good fit in the role. So far it has worked out very well. I have a training program set up for new hires to get their feet under them and then set them up to eventually train their own replacement and leave. For my org this works as I don't have the funds to hire those with experience but I can train people up who will eventually help the skills gap. We also take on interns every summer albeit not from any college that has a CS or computer science degree paths(not my choice).   I think the reason so many people feel it is impossible to get into falls into a few categories. Unwilling to move for a job, inadequate personal marketing, or not willing to settle. There are probably a good portion that just have bad luck or are bad at interviews but I think the majority I've personally met fall into these categories. Not willing to move is a killer. I understand sometimes it's not possible but for the majority you should consider applying nationally and finding a job that way (there are tons on the east coast).  Inadequate marketing, take advantage of any and all opportunities to get a good resume. Ask for help. Network at events(that's how I find my people). Most importantly you should be applying to at least 11 jobs a day. Use an excel to manage who you have applied to and their details/dates. Follow up with a call a week or two later (how I got my first info security job). Most importantly don't worry about imposter syndrome just do your best and don't undersell yourself out of fear. Last, is being unwilling to settle, you probably won't find a red team job unless you are top 1% that's ok, it can be a hobby until then. Most of the openings are in GRC just take the job and learn. I guarantee getting a big picture view of security will help you tons. Be willing to take a position to get your foot in the door, even if it's for lower pay. Just get in learn some things and 6 months later if they don't compensate to your skills/value move on for more pay and repeat the advice in marketing yourself. Make the companies compete for you.

I mean do all of our students have full admin access and use generic admin accounts with the same password?  Yes.

So basically it doesn't matter what you install or do on these machines because we can literally boot into this software and set the computer back to a pre-configured 'default' state.    &#x200B;  I get your point though but my problem really comes down to the shortage of faculty with real experience and credentials teaching this material.

We have similar heuristics under the hood to what you described, but these are *mostly* to combat spammers/advertisers as we can make those rules pretty dang accurate.

i89xqby,"It's a good idea on paper, but hard to implement in practice.  * "Entry level" is nebulous. Sure, anyone who isn't currently in tech has their question removed. But if you have a career in IT, can you ask questions? What if you're pretty deep into your career in tech? What if you've [signed an offer for/started] your first security job already? How can we assess this clearly and fairly, and without asking for self-identification of posters? * Even if we figure out a succinct answer to the above, would people understand the division before posting? Some will if they're frequent posters here, but many won't - especially if any other career questions are allowed (see footnote for more info on this particular subject). * The above problem compounds for this subreddit specifically because we get a ton of organic traffic - a lot of people posting breaking in questions are posting here for the first time. * Since we know that there will be at least some career questions that are "entry level" slipping past, how do we make enforcement for this viable with a handful of unpaid moderators? Content-based enforcement will not catch all entry-level questions (as we see now, rip), but it will catch at least common ones. While we expand this, we also increase the number of false positives that need to be approved out of the filter - I think I approve ~20 false positive removals or reports per day across all our filtering rules currently, but haven't measured that.  The above reads a bit like a doom-and-gloom scenario, but given the volume of the questions we receive even post-filtering right now, it's already proven to be a tough nut to crack. From those problems there are a couple further ideas though: * Prevent people from creating career threads until they've participated in other conversations on the subreddit, as a sort of litmus test for "you've got an idea of what's happening here, no matter what phase of career you're in." This would cost a little bit of money to run but wouldn't be too bad to write a bot for, and doesn't rely on user self-identification. * Expand a bank of FAQs with rich search features, and then use content filters to remove career questions which appear to be partially or completely answerable by FAQ (for example, by writing a bot that uses semantic similarity to match a given FAQ question to a post). Then the problem is actually getting people to write for that, which didn't work out in the past, but could work in the future if we offered some sort of incentives?

I have interviewed multiple candidates with that experience and none could articulate basic networking concepts nor could they speak to any familiarity with tools like a SIEM, or give a general explanation of how one would handle an incident.

Again, I understand these all are anecodtal examples, but I hear this constantly amongst peers that the degree programs(as a whole) aren't quite there yet.

Run it as advice only without taking automated action until you have enough data that the model starts consistently (you define the tolerance for error) giving you the advice you would give yourself. At that point, you can start automated actions with an appeal function, probably using only the most high-confidence determinations at first. As it starts getting more accurate, you can decrease the confidence threshold.

CCNA, imo, is a lot more in-depth than CompTIA Net+ and is obviously vendor specific (although its very similar to console for Juniper and Aristas). The CCNA goes much more into configuration of different Cisco devices such as their switches and routers, understanding different routing protocols, heavy into understanding subnetting and VLANs, IPv4, IPv6 (make sure you understand the difference between unicast, multicast, how to setup routing and last resort gateways), setting up and understanding ACLs, a bit of SNMP, troubleshooting connection issues, setting up failover connections, Wireless Lan Setup with a Controller, and they have more recently mixed in configuration management/automation topics like Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt and their own proprietary management tools. The list could could go on, but I felt like Net+ was a breeze compared to taking the CCNA exam. I would say that its helped me a lot in my current role and my past role as it gave me a solid foundation of networking to work off of and helped me significantly in troubleshooting networking/firewall related issues.  As far as in a security role, it really depends on what role you plan on doing. In a network security or engineering role, it would probably be very beneficial to have some of the knowledge from the CCNA as you're dealing with and setting up infrastructure to be secure, but still communicate properly.

if605zx,"I'm going to give you my long-form perspective because you are clearly passionate about cybersecurity and the plight of the entry pipeline and I resonate with that. First, a bit about me; I've been in cybersecurity for 12 years and I'm an enterprise security architect specialized in OT/IT security convergence working for a major consulting organization. I've worked in several industries including public sector and I regularly help global organizations design and implement security programs across technology stacks. I say this just to give you a sense of my experience level.   What you're trying to accomplish is good and necessary for the continued effectiveness of defenders against our adversaries, but the method you're proposing is missing critical context. As others have noted, there is general confusion as to why the pipeline for new talent is so difficult all around the industry. New folks don't know how to break into the industry, employers don't know how to hire/retain key security roles, and security leaders don't know how to find talented folks they can train to build security teams. It's a clear issue but the cause is, in my opinion, often oversimplified or misunderstood.   Deciding who should secure my assets is fundamentally a question of trust. People hire cybersecurity folks to protect what is most important from them from threats they don't understand using methods they don't know how to do. Not only do I need to trust the person to act ethically and be free of outside pressures, but more importantly I need to trust that they know how protect my assets effectively. Our field is very immature in establishing the institutional ethical aspect of trust, to the degree that we have decades to go before we're anywhere near as trustworthy on that axis as accountants or lawyers. That's a problem we should solve, but worse is the competency trust barrier.  Imagine showing up to the emergency room because you're experiencing really bad chest pains. You don't know what's wrong and you're scared it could be fatal. When the doctor comes to examine you, they tell you that you're actually their first patient and they just graduated medical school that morning! As a person with societal benefit in mind, you'd be glad to see someone joining the exciting field of medicine and building up to be a great doctor someday. You'd also probably ask for a more experienced person to help you through your medical crisis.   That's the issue with entry level cybersecurity. No one wants unproven talent to be the difference between their organization's success and ruin. Organizations don't hire for future success in this field, they hire for their security needs at the moment with people they can count on to deliver. The only way most organizations know to measure the ability to deliver is past experience (as weak as that can be). Expecting most organizations to put "unreliable" people in a position where they are most vulnerable is unrealistic.   Obviously that doesn't leave a natural pathway for the uninitiated to get the level of experience to be "reliable," which is the problem you're trying to solve. As you've observed, training and simulation doesn't cut it for most organizations to trust new members of this field enough to hire them. The issue with your approach is that you expect organizations to trust unproven talent enough to treat their potentially devastating cyber incidents as a training exercise. Organizations are already cagey about disclosing information about potential breaches to their contracted partners, but treating it like a training sandbox for neophytes would be unacceptable for almost any organization that would be mature enough for threat hunting to be relevant.   The volunteer service idea has merit but threat hunting is the wrong venue for new personnel. If you're looking to build red team skills, bug bounties and pro bono vulnerability disclosures are a good way to build provable experience without expecting an organization to trust unproven people. If it's defense skills, compliance, auditing, and research/training are useful free services to provide. Industry research and threat intelligence feeds tailored to specific clients may also be viable for volunteer services. Threat response (including hunting) is really not something organizations are looking to trust to anyone besides established trusted insiders or experienced expert partners.   Internship programs for SOC positions do exist with some large organizations, but they're not a real solution to this issue at the moment. As others have mentioned, cybersecurity isn't currently a job employers expect you to be competent enough to do right out of school/training. The real challenge is proving that these non-employment onramps to the career translate to real security results after folks are employed. Certs are not winning that challenge and neither are degrees or simulations. Mentors are a good way to establish that, but mentors are usually too busy to spend a lot of time on the next generation. If you could figure out a way to make the workload of "mentor level" cybersecurity folks worth it, such as by providing volunteer administrative assistance (copy editing, report formatting, framework alignment, etc.), you'd get access to a viable avenue to entry level positions. It's not sexy or exciting to prospective new entries to the field, and that's a real problem for cultivating the passion and skills to succeed in cybersecurity, but it's something I think could help folks willing to do some of the grunt work in exchange for some real organizational context.",countvonruckus,1657166995.0,20,t3_vt0366,vt0366

This convoluted process of IT helpdesk gatekeeping into the industry instead of training people into it is a relic of the past (and unfortunately the present). Others have made this argument better than I could all over this subreddit, some of those arguments cited in this thread.

if5y09e,"I'm a threat hunter and hunting is time consuming. Between getting a topic, doing research, doing the hunting, and writing the report it can easily add up.   Also, there are some specific hunts you could always get results for, but most of the time you don't always find "bad". There is a reason it's a proactive service. Either find some type of misconfiguration before it turns bad, find something that was able to go undetected, or find the root cause to activity that was picked up.  As others have mentioned the biggest barrier would be to allow volunteers to get access to someone's environment. Getting onboarded with new clients already takes ages while being part of a company. I can't imagine it happening smoothly in this situation.  When it comes to tools and actually hunting will you just use whatever the client has? Every organization is different and could be a company that only has tools like Splunk, ExtraHop, or Carbon Black. Those are all different skill sets that can't always be picked up easily.

However most of these focus on delivering a service using volunteers. I think the difference is you’re really suggesting a training program that also provides a service, like how I can get free dental check ups by going to my local dental school and giving students a real world person to practice on. This is different from a service that happens to also have a good training program, like how if I wanted to volunteer in a fire department I’d have to attend a full fire academy.   I think you need to decide which side of the coin you’re on; is this a security service or training program? It really must identify as one or the other, despite doing both. A better example framework to look at would be PISCES out of Washington state which was also recently picked up in Colorado, which creates a scalable SOC-as-a-Service model that trains college students on basic security monitoring and response with minimal invasion into the customer network.   I have often dreamed of a civilian cyber corps, similar to the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, to fill this niche. Many people seem intent on placing these types of volunteer efforts into some military function, which I think becomes a major detractor to bringing in young talent or even older people interested in career switching into cybersecurity.   A lot of people highlighted the liability risk which is 100% accurate but not the show stopper some make it out to be. Like my prior examples, several governments are using volunteers in cybersecurity capacities already, from risk assessments to pen tests to incident response, and we’ve worked around the liability issues using lawyers and lots of documentation.",MaybeZoidberg,1657431204.0,1,t3_vt0366,vt0366

if4ukjw,">In addition to that many businesses are probably not going to be willing to give a random group of nobody's complete access to their network to hunt.  This part is fair. I'm thinking if the customer is a non-profit who can't afford to hire a real security firm and all of our volunteers:  * have validated identities * legal paperwork (NDAs) * verifiably live in the same country as the company being assessed  then they have a lot more risk against real attackers stealing their sensitive data than a team of identified, validated, legally bound individuals punishable by significant modern laws regulating malicious cyber activity, IP theft, etc.  Also, not that this alleviates the privacy risk, but any risk of actual destruction of the network on accident could be significantly mitigated by only requesting access to their security logs via a SPAN port connected to a small server which forwards logs over a secure tunnel to our Elastic Stack infrastructure, which we could lend via mail to the client as part of the contract. In other words, we don't have direct access to their network in terms of being able to send commands. Credentials? Yes. For sure. But we're not accidentally bringing anything down.  It's not the simplest thing, but I bet a bunch of college, maybe even struggling post-grad geeks would happily sign up for the experience if we offer to train them to do it and they get basically the ultimate cyber playground to work with - a real network.  But I don't entirely disagree, it would be a hard sell to most potential clients. There are also other legal concerns.

Would this volunteer group be considered substantial competition to other businesses? Practically speaking, based on your own point, probably not. Legally? Perhaps. I'm not a lawyer.  &#x200B;  >I'm interested in the idea but I think you'll find threat hunting more time consuming than your expecting for an all volunteer team.

My thought is that a combination of licensing for trusted defenders (not just certification) and employment contracts tied to signing bonuses are a good way forward. If we as a field build out a licensing body similar to the bar association or the state boards of accountancy then we will be in a better position to impose ethics and competency requirements and build a network of professional accountability. That raises the bar for entry level talent in the eyes of employers. Employers should also take the proven strategy of signing bonuses tied to continued retention (for 1-3 years typically) and apply it to the entry level where it can be used as an incentive to stay long enough to grow into the role and become entrenched in the organization.

With the right value proposition it'll get traction and support.  On the general IT side, my thinking is to basically create a MSP/MSSP that only serves non profits and staff it w/ a trainer and a core of experienced MSP techs that will be paid commensurate w/ their experience. The goal is for the experienced techs and trainer is to train up the non experienced folks into learning CSR skills, Tier 1 and then 2 help desk skills, then break off into networks, infra, and cyber. Since my MSP already does this w/ entry level people, save a formal cyber track right now, this already has a framework to follow. The way we pay for this is charging the non profits a fee for services and they get all the services for whatever service delivery cost of that service ends up being. I have a list of businesses and people to hit up to fund this for the 1st year as we ramp up and get non profit clients signed up.

if80hzh,"That's actually the point of my example; this isn't how medicine works because patients wouldn't trust someone fresh out of medical school with no direct experience with something as critical as their emergency care. The issue with the cybersecurity entry-level pipeline is that we expect organizations to trust fresh graduates without direct experience with something as critical as securing their assets, and most prefer to use more proven talent.  The structures you talk about in how doctors are initiated in the field are possible for cybersecurity but currently missing. I advocate for a licensing program similar to the bar association or state boards of accountancy to better build ethics and competency requirements and a network of professional accountability like other fields like law, nursing, or accounting. I'd pair that with entry level employment contracts tied to signing bonuses linked to retention for 1-3 years. This creates more trust for employers that new talent is qualified and will stick around long enough to grow into a role past the initial period where they may not be reliable.   As far as the "nurses or physical therapists to become doctors" part, I think there's a difference in the medical body of knowledge and the cybersecurity body of knowledge that breaks the analogy a bit. Much of medical training can become extremely high-level and remain relevant for an entire career, which is why doctors go through so much more training than lower-tier medical professionals (though obviously they still need to stay up to date with changes in the field). Cybersecurity is so new and constantly changing that academic training just isn't perceived as vital to successful security practice as it is in medicine. If I got a degree in the beginning of my career, most of the technical knowledge and information about the threat landscape would be obsolete by now, but my recent experience in doing security for organizations shows that I can engage with the current cybersecurity situation for other organizations. Successful cybersecurity professionals need to do more on-the-job learning than professionals in more established fields like accounting, so professional experienced cyber folks can usually demonstrate professional knowledge at a similar level to academically trained folks.",countvonruckus,1657210041.0,4,t1_if7ikq3,vt0366

That led to becoming a vulnerability manager (they had a vulnerability problem) and eventually that led to building up my technical skills for security program strategy and architecture. A few job hops and new industries later and I'm an enterprise security architect with a specialty.   It's a good approach to get proven experience in security-relevant skills for getting any infosec job, but that experience doesn't have to be in a security role.

if7ilbj,"To be fair, let me provide some insight on these comments from a leadership perspective. In my own role, I've worked closely with recruiters and HR to append job postings to smash the experience as much as possible. There are still hurdles, and there are reasons for it.       I've been turned down so many times, despite my degrees and certs, because I don't have +      years experience. HIRE ME, TEACH ME!  There are merely barriers set up to filter the candidate pool down. If you ever see a job actually require a specific industry certification, I would not want to work there anyway. It most likely means they have nothing for training and you're going to be left to your devices to figure out new trends. Certifications are there as "nice to haves" or "preferred" because it shows you already have gone through some sort of specific training in a realm the employer cares about, and naturally, puts you a step ahead of your competition.   Degrees are merely a barrier in this day and age to make sure you're getting candidates that can demonstrate they 1) are multi-diverse in their learning (hence your generals and probably some of your classes you have taken), 2) can demonstrate they stick through something that can be stressful, and 3) have at least been exposed to concepts. Keep in mind the degree you started 3 years ago is probably in large part already outdated. Not to mention, I've basically seen 3 schools' undergrad degrees actually put their students through a rigor of hands-on knowledge. All 3 schools also have a sponsorship with well-known consultancies that are run by industry thought leaders as a result of this.   But keep in mind, that you are at least not on a career path that pretty much mandates you get an actual license, and where your school's name means something on your resume. Go talk to some lawyers and accountants about the hell they go through.       Stuff like this makes me sad and angry. I wouldn’t have been able to staff an internal SOC      without establishing a pipeline via local colleges and universities and I hired a lot of recent      undergrads and graduate students with zero experience, almost all of them turned out fine.  It sucks it is this way, but there is a reason these can be successful. Largely because you can "vet" the degree curriculum and advise on it. I don't know of a Dean or Professor who would say otherwise. It builds credibility in their own program over others and drives student enrollment. I also will make your leaders happy to be able to feel like they are giving back. Stupid, I know, but an evil that at least gets the door open.       I also hired a mix of experience and I experience for a reason. I also had a detailed training      and growth path for all levels for career progression. It’s a lot of work to do that but a      necessity IMHO.  Absolutely agree. For perspective, when I go through resumes out of the candidate pool, I'm told beforehand how many we can select for interviews. People have to remember that this whole thing is a well-orchestrated dance recital that involves many people. To set it all up and have it move smoothly takes some logistics, especially when your leadership is typically bogged down for days on end. That means I usually get 3-5 tops. If I get 50 applicants, I'm looking at what, 10% "you made it through to the 2nd round."  So I am looking for things that set you apart.       This shit isn’t hard….a lot of businesses make it harder than it should be because, well, they’re      all F’in clueless.  This is a comment we all have in our careers, and you learn very quickly how ignorant it is when you get higher up the food chain. People don't realize everything that gets put into account with hiring. A lot of things are in motion because that person's "up front" cost, along with recurring costs need to be factored into the decision. Where this comment has merit is that Hiring Managers typically are too specific in what they want, or they don't care to give them a headcount. HR just wants the headcount filled, and will use a default job posting if the hiring manager does not specify what they want or not. The F'ing clueless on the PEOPLE piece is pretty sound.       not a firm believer that a CISO must be an MBA business understanding aficionado. I feel it’s      people like them that are making cyber roles tougher to fill and setting unrealistic      expectations for roles they have zero clue about.  MBA's = Vice Presidents. The whole premise behind the SEC strongly advising that CISO's be Board Members made a lot of us laugh, as your CIO/COO/CTO etc are not even on the board. This is just one more position that will be politicized into a person the CEO/Board knows from other lands and wants over here. I liken it to pro sports and how Coaches and GMs seem to always get hired into new jobs, even though the other one failed.   However, the reason this is still the bar is pretty much two reasons IMO:   1) VPs at companies are not in their early 30's unless it's a startup. Guy Rosen, Meta's CISO, is roughly 38 years old. Even when Guy was in college back in 2003, cybersecurity degrees didn't exist. To expect someone 10 years his senior to have one is pretty silly.  2) MBA's demonstrate, or attempt to, a person understands business operations and can speak to any department through their own lingo and jargon to get the job done. Furthermore, CISOs are typically charged with more than just overseeing SOC and IR operations. They typically are going to have entire departments relating to things like Cloud, IAM, etc., underneath them as well. They rely on their Directors to gather information and provide it in a business manner in order to provide it up-channel or make decisions based on it. That doesn't require a cybersecurity degree per se.   Do I think we'll start seeing it? Absolutely. Things like Equifax showed how silly it can be to have someone in a high-level role with no true cybersecurity understanding in their career can be detrimental. But that process takes time, and most likely I'll be well into my twilight years before we see it. Businesses move at a snail's pace when it comes to this type of change.       Some of the best CISOs I’ve worked with were not business people, they were bottom up      grown and developed cyber security people who were in the trenches for a long time and      decided to work their way up.  Would absolutely agree the best tend to not be business-minded. Know what else they are? Not listened to by anyone above them. Unless your President/CEO is truly interested in cybersecurity (which many won't even give it more than 1% of their time in the year), having someone who pushes back on other department leads because "security" turns into the head coach that every player ignores.       Sadly, we’ll continue this trend…..and I’ll continue to be sad and angry that so many      companies are casting aside excellent talent for no reason whatsoever  I don't agree with the doom and gloom, but I do understand where it coming from. That is probably because I know a lot of people who got degrees back in the late 90's and early 00's that were told would be lucrative pathways to financial wealth, only those jobs have been overly saturated, and are literally next to impossible to crack. Not to mention at their age/experience, it is impossible to move because it is cheaper to hire younger.   My personal opinion is this goes back to the whole "MBA and CISO" thing. How many here know bosses in their chain that were either A) Management-track people with no experience or B) were the senior technical person there and they just promoted them because they had to? To me, that is where the problem is. Sometimes putting technical people in leadership roles is absolutely asinine because they lack soft skills and the ability to manage administrative tasks and/or pulling out of operational tasks (e.g., what they did before they got promoted). You combine that type of micromanaging, or lack of managing, along with someone with in-depth understanding of how cybersecurity works (let alone IT in general) and you get into the pickle we are in. Ideally, an MBA style management Graduate-level degree will be curated to Cybersecurity Management.",bigt252002,1657202756.0,1,t1_if4k62c,vt0366
ify1lky,"I fullheartedly agree that this is a myth. Cybersecurity is entry-level, upper management level, and everything  in between.  I think the real challenge is that organizations look to limit the investment as much as possible because it is a sunk cost. That means minimal hires. And if you aren't hiring many folks, and your scared about getting it right, your probably not about to hire an entry level position. You need to hire people you can trust, and that can establish your security program, and an entry level employee that has no real world understanding of the industry just doesn't fit the bill for that situation.  It's a hard problem to solve and I don't blame employers. I think the easiest way to get into the field is through consultancies, where employers can at least trust that the entry level consultant has internal resources at their firm backing their limited experience and knowledge.",Decent-Dig-7432,1657681735.0,2,t1_if5c0c3,vt0366

One reason, as I'm sure you saw (or maybe didn't, it's a long post), that I chose threat hunting was for the lack of time constraints being a pretty good factor for volunteers, who shouldn't / can't be pressured to do things on a strict timeline. Helping them with compliance and general hardening is something I mentioned as a follow-up to the hunt. Compliance guidance / giving general hardening advice shares this benefit.  However, compliance on it's own... it's not sexy. Like you and me, we probably think compliance is a pretty interesting challenge. I mean, you have it in your tagline, I've recently been introduced to it and am really enjoying that understanding of how we can scale and measure these fundamental security concepts through it.  But on its own, general hardening advice + compliance is not something I think I can get entry-level volunteers really excited about and engaged in for a long period. Like, "Hey guys, so uh, today we're going to read the NIST Risk Management Framework" lol. I mean, I can get behind it, I like it, but let's be real. It's not the thing that most people are starting out excited and passionate about in this field. It's something you sort of grow into and learn to appreciate after a few years.  Hunting on the other hand, it forces us to flex knowledge at every aspect of the network and endpoint technical spectrum, it's sexy, it's extremely engaging, and I've been studying it a lot so it's the one thing I'm confident I could build a fairly decent entry level training pipeline for, mentor people, teach them to work a SIEM, etc.  So I see your point, but I see some friction there too.",Jonathan-Todd,1657149706.0,3,t1_if4xyyg,vt0366

If ongoing they must be renewed periodically for applicability. 3) measurement of the org's ability to meet the requirements. This is not focused on the approved, valid, exceptions. It is focused on this controls not met without an approved exception. For your example of vulnerability scanning there should be a requirement that states vulnerabilities of x severity on systems of y criticality or with z data must be remediated within t period. There are cases where it is not possible and in those, there must be an approved exception.

At one stop along my career, I spent 3 years administering VMware, Citrix and EMC storage with my Microsoft duties, I got a cert in all 3. At this point in my career, I don't put any of those on my resume because I'm a decade removed from that experience but will reference the experience and certs in an interview if asked because it proves that I have the ability to learn and master something enough to pass a cert, even if for a period of time.   I got my CCNA at one point because I had always dabbled in Cisco, spent the summer studying up and passed the exam and I've administered Cisco networks to some degree at every point in my career. I've let that cert lapse because since then, but can still talk the talk when dealing with Cisco networks regardless of that cert.   Passing tons of certs isn't bad, it's just how you use them to advance your career. All a cert does is prove your familiarity and competence at that point in time.

But if there was another way to demonstrate this that had validation, then certs wouldn't matter that much.

Social proof by way of comments and feedback validate what you're posting and it also has the benefit of generating value to anyone interested in the topic. I'm talking about posting on Medium, LinkedIn, etc.   For me, certs should be deliberate because they take so much time and commitment that I could invest in many, many other parts of my job (such as learning about other teams and business units). If they are relevant to my role, I'll go for them. But at the end of the day, it's experience that counts.   When I see someone's profile that's littered with certs, I'll take a closer look to see if those certs are relevant to their role. In some cases, they absolutely are (eg consultants, trainers).

ifc73xu,"To share my own experiences, I am a Cyber Specialist for the DoD. This was my first job in cyber and I had a fire burning inside of me to learn all I could considering my passion for the field. To start:  •I had different expectations of what working in cyber security was going to be like, I found out quickly it was not at all what I thought. Spending a majority time in Excel copy and pasting, working on POAMs & Control decks for vendors.  •I figured it would be best to learn from the most senior analyst on the team…this benefited me for the first two weeks before I quickly realized…he did not have good teaching skills but was extremely knowledgeable in this field and the job itself. I realized this when I would be instructed to complete a task, without a lengthy block of instruction or explanation. Whenever I would ask for help / further explanation on something, it seemed I was always belittled or made feel incompetent for not knowing already OR not knowing based of the small block of instruction.   •this was extremely discouraging, worrying any mistakes I made we going to lead to me being be belittled. I suffer from Anxiety already (as I’m sure most of you can relate) about 4 months in I’m waking up everyday not wanting to work.. scouring other jobs to see if there is a better option for me.  This was the biggest hurdle for me to overcome, and I found out quickly that there are other team members that are just as knowledgeable in Cybersecurity and the tasks of the job. I got into a rhythm of asking another  team member for help/ advice/ a second opinion on things which has in turn built my confidence. He has always reassured me that “he knows how it is being new” and “we’ve all been there at some point” so he takes absolute best approach at explaining things and I relay that block of instruction with the explanation at the end to confirm I really understand. This has helped me so much as far as feeling comfortable and dealing with imposter syndrome, there are people that are willing to help and will be understanding of your knowledge base / current skill set/ and lack of understanding in some areas.   •the take away from this, it’s hard not to get discouraged sometimes especially when your surrounded by those whore very knowledgeable and “work” seems easy for them, Almost like second natures   Do NOT be so hard on yourself and understand we all have to start somewhere.

You don't ever really get rid of it, you just accept it.  As an application tester I pretty much never know what is going on with an app on a new test until im done with the test... you pretty much always feel lost. But the constant exploration is the fun part! :)  You do get used to some basic techniques and tools and you'll become more comfortable with them. Thats where the confidence will eventually come from, but you'll probably never feel like you really "get it all" in the field. It's just too much, too big of a field to keep track of it all.  Keep in mind that most people that talk big in cyber security are overly confident about what they know. My experience is that many of these people are good at a few specific things, and that carries them through their carrier. Not saying its wrong, it's just how the field works due to the complexity.   My suggesting on getting over it is to get really good at one really really specific thing in pentesting. For example, testing web service workers, cross-origin browser communication, or oauth2 implementations. Eventually you will be the go-to person for that one thing, and you'll feel more comfortable with not knowing other things.

ieuoe6v,"Really important thing to note. Sure, sometimes it's on the employee (especially if new) to ask, but more times than not this is an issue with the employer or the culture by not working closely with you and explaining your expectations/role. Oftentimes this issue stems from a lack of onboarding, and once someone passes the initial probation period or first year then the company/management switches to an expectation that you should know everything. It's definitely where that feeling or sense of dread comes from.  Your comment really hit the nail on the head for me. I got on a "red team" about a year ago having only parallel experience for security. I was forthcoming in the lengthy interview process, but in the end the team liked me and I was given the opportunity despite lacking the credentials. I busted my ass in the first year and acquired a couple big industry certs as asked, but I'm still woefully inexperienced.  That wasn't an issue as my director and lead were patient and willing to help mentor me, but then they both left the company, and I had no support. Now, everyone that I interface with expects me to be an expert because I'm part of this group, not knowing my limited experience. Our group has dwindled and I'm typically who presents for our team, which is ridiculous. I have no support, direction, or guidance which is frustrating. That's the hardest part, not knowing my expectations, or putting too much on myself even when no one else has. I've learning how important it is to get past the mentality of trying to be the solution for everyone/everything, and being able to say I can't help or I don't know.   On the flip side I have a good paying job and my reviews have been glowing, routinely being awarded, which I think leans into OPs post. I legitimately know I'm under qualified and inexperienced, but I've passed several major certs with limited to no experience, and been praised by coworkers. So if they're more knowledgeable and they think I'm doing ok, then I must be faking it well enough for the time being.

Yes, dedicated, skilled adversaries can work around them but for every one of those there are a dozen low-skill "spray and pray" actors where a blacklist is going to make you difficult enough for them to ignore.  Having the people and infrastructure (SIEM, etc) to detect attacks is not something you should skimp on even if you don't blacklist (because you want to find the successful attacks) so there is really no savings to not blacklisting.  Whitelisting is in general better, but has two serious caveats: 1) Not every service can be whitelisted. Public websites can't whitelist clients. Mail servers can't whitelist domains sending them email. Even some that theoretically could, your whitelist would require so much maintenance it's not feasible. 2) Many of the "working around" issues you are describing also apply in some ways to whitelisting (think lateral movement) which zero trust tries to address, and that's why zero trust gets more marketing dollars these days.

ihhz1i0,"I’m going to use the more updated terms “allow list” and “block list” since it’s what I use at work. The TL;DR is that both approaches have advantages and disadvantages that make them appropriate in different settings.  -IP allow listing followed by a default deny is used for systems with very limited legitimate points of access. For example, you might only want three internal IPs to communicate with your SQL server, and all others to be blocked.  -IP block listing can be used as a countermeasure on a system that needs to communicate with a wide range of systems (where a simple allow list would be inappropriate). Let’s say a web server—you want almost any legitimate IP address to be able to communicate with it over ports 80/443. If you see an attacker connecting, you would blocklist that IP address. It will not permanently deny them access, but it may slow them down and force them to rotate infrastructure.   Also, sometimes it can be more inconvenient for an attacker than simply switching IPs. Think of malware with a single hard-coded C2 IP. If you blocklist that IP, it effectively orphans the malware and forces the adversary to manually regain access.

And yes, blacklisting does take CPU cycles, I was worried about that too. But the difference is that traffic is being dropped at the network interface card (well, right thereafter), so it doesn’t go through the rulebases of the firewalls. So even though blacklisting does take CPU cycles, it is a lot less as regular handling of traffic. (Ratelimiting works the same way: traffic doesn’t hit the rulebases either.)  I get your aversion against blacklisting, I’m not the biggest fan of it either.

ihi4zm3,"It's interesting you mention that. It's precisely the example that I've had on my mind for a while now. I'm interested in segmenting the host just like we segment networks. In the DoD there's this notion of high-side and low-side. There's physical separation between web browsing infrastructure and sensitive infrastructure. I like the idea of applying that concept to the private sector but without the expense of physical separation nor the friction of separate systems.  I've talked about this in a post before about seamless containerization within a Windows host but I'm starting to wonder about going a step further than that. You know how you can SSH into a box with X11 forwarding enabled and interact with a GUI application on the remote system? I wonder if we can do something like that with our endpoint applications and then apply controls on data xfer between those containers depending on sensitivity. So you click one icon and it looks like the browser opens locally but really it's a (local or potentially remote) container and if you open your personal email and get phished, that malware that gets dropped is pre-quarantined. The user can work with the downloaded file, but because it's tagged as originating from a container meant for public web browsing, when you open it (let's say a spreadsheet) the container running Excel is actually separate from the one accessing your customer data. All this is made seamless so the only time the user experiences friction is when they want to move data tracked as being lower trust to a higher trust "zone".",Jonathan-Todd,1658701231.0,3,t1_ihi2ks8,w75gs0

Let me start I’m a 29 year old and I career pivoted amidst the pandemic time 2019-2020 from hospitality (server) I applied back to school after graduating with my A.S in Physical Therapy Assistance, but that was during the pandemic, so I couldn’t land a job at that time. I’ve since then pursued my Cyber Journey. Since then I applied back to college to pursue my bachelors and finished my sec+ before that. Side note of certs - don’t think that just because you have em you’re assured the job, it only shows good for hr screening. After that it’s only a sliver of the working environment. Aside from sec+, I only did gamified cyber platforms like TryHackMe, offsec, securityblue team etc. I also did keep up a blog to show progress of work.   As for the internship it’s for a FinTech. I started the interview process maybe late Jan 2022 Early Feb. it was through indeed. I’m about 3 weeks in for the 12 week program and it’s been a blast! Learning everything, seeing how things are interconnected on the business side. I always thought cyber was full of logs, wireshark, technical stuff, which is only partly true. Cyber as a whole is small inner workings of teams specialized in their field that come together. As of yet, I haven’t done any daily log or network monitoring - something that I thought I would be doing a lot more of.   Day to day I’ve been given a couple projects, one was assuring data was recorded from an MSP that my company bought, another is more security apps and what the organization allows, and a blog post. So they have me in a jungle gym of projects, all of which I’m very excited about.   Regarding internships as an idea though, I am glad organizations are actually opening up actual entry level positions. A lot of adults / entitled folk out of college are seeking that 6 figure salary right out of the box. Like that’s insane. I get it times are tough, but you’re telling me you aren’t willing to try a help desk, or put more work, or network and expect a silver spoon? That’s bs.   People, don’t sleep on internships.

The big issue for log4j is alot of people don't even know whether they have the vulnerable version, this is because log4j is a logging dependancy used in some java applications which then may be used as dependencies in a technology the client deploys. This nested dependency leads to a indirect dependancy, which is hard to detect.  Here is an [image from google](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/EjNUi1ZvMv7PQ6z1NCszLP0P96SoBVGZcYnV7F7iQsIv_TDCPpiWrroKuLnCDpSKFLj-mg3hQV29yjDpsEA3qehfK7X42qRMa-xq3mqytSXT40lDR0Vd6IS_CQnofmw-mCqlePNeA3s90ygortIpMKbrxPeu0Q8ZcVMm3W3ohTel74ko=w627-h252) depicting how a vulnerable log4j package can be hidden within a system.  When you look at how pen testers are trying to identify log4j usage, they are generally just spamming every input with generic payloads to just try get a response back from somewhere rather than attacking anything specifically, the shotgun approach.  &#x200B;  In short: The first step of responding to a threat is identifying it, this can be done actively or proactively, in the case of log4j many  people are struggling to identify if they have it and where they have it, then comes the task of reporting it and waiting for a vendor to patch it. This is without going into the supply chain issue of the many open source packages being maintained by one person, so waiting for a fix can also take time.  &#x200B;  After all this you then have to deal with patching, which other comments in this post have mentioned.",markyman217,1656599963.0,5,t3_vo7up9,vo7up9

Zero trust enables things like remote work and BYOD because the endpoint and the network it resides in doesn't define the permissions given, so unsecured home networks and devices don't pose as much of a threat in a higher trust networking model. SecOps in a mature zero trust environment doesn't care if the developers are onsite or remote.

ijwl1g4,"Alright, I finally had time to dig into the report. First, let me make a minor correction to your post; this is specifically a study of organizations that have had a data breach, so 100% of organizations studied had at least one breach and 83% of those organizations reported that this wasn't their first breach. Also, all of the cost/benefit numbers reflect the cost per breach, not cost/benefit for an org per year, so something like MFA and context aware user access can save ~4.5 million per breach, not necessarily per year. Other than that, your observations seem pretty solid.  As to what I took away from it, the length of time to detect and eradicate a breach continues to be awful for the field. We really need to up our detection, response, and recovery game. Reading between the lines it seems like ~40-55% of orgs that got breached  were trying to keep up with security trends like XDR and AI driven security tools. The number of orgs following trends is likely significantly higher since more mature security shops are more likely to prevent breaches and wouldn't be measured by this report. Interesting info on paying a ransom averages saving an organization ~$500k, so it probably doesn't make sense to pay (or charge) more than that unless it's a mega breach. I was also surprised that physical compromise was ore common than BEC or social engineering.  One thing to note; this is a very academic report and could be misread or misused by leadership. This is probably most useful for doing FAIR analysis to have data on impact of different events and controls, but doesn't give any info on prevention of breaches. For example, MFA probably does a lot more to prevent a breach than it does to reduce the impact of a breach, so the positive impact of implementing MFA is higher than this report would imply if read the wrong way. Also, this is only the impact of data breaches with a narrow definition of what that data is. DoS attacks, spying, breaches of IP that isn't PII/PHI, spam/nuisance attacks like cryptomining, or ICS/OT attacks wouldn't be covered under this report. Most importantly, this isn't even all ransomware attacks; attacks against non-HR business systems often wouldn't be a "data breach" in this context. These aren't faults of the report per se, but you have to be careful to make the right conclusions from the report. For instance, you might conclude that a security control that costs $2 million a year isn't worth investing in if it only reduces the cost of a data breach by $500k, but if that control prevents attacks from becoming a breach or limits mega breaches (both of which are out of scope of this report) then it may still make business sense to implement.",countvonruckus,1660249706.0,2,t3_wl5n37,wl5n37

Definitely agree with you that the scope of the report can be misleading, but it's also hard to quantify the absolute value of something like MFA (how would you even calculate the value of breaches possibly prevented?) so there's a lot of moving in the dark here.  Would you say there's value in practitioners doing their own write-up based on this and presenting their needs to leadership instead of forwarding the report straight to leadership?

ijx3rzv,"Thanks for engaging with me on this. I've been following IBM's reports for several years and this one's always been very tightly scoped and presented to a research-oriented audience, so it's easy to draw incorrect conclusions if you don't really dig into the scope and methodology. The data is super valuable in the right context, such as if you're specifically trying to measure the likely financial impact of a particular database being breached to pair with a suspected/known likelihood of a threat performing that breach to calculate annualized loss expectation. However, unless you're really digging into that kind of analysis it can lead to inferences like "annual ransomware costs are decreased by $3 million if we implement XDR, but XDR costs $6 million to implement and license so we shouldn't procure XDR." Or worse, "this report shows our collection of security products only reduce data breach expenses by $4 million and we're spending $10 million on our security program; time to cut costs in that department." That's my concern around folks who aren't technical security analysts misreading this report.   Like you say, it's hard to quantify the absolute value of security controls, but there are methods for getting somewhere close. I mentioned FAIR methodology and the report alludes to it, and it is possible to use that to quantify something like the value of MFA. It's difficult and requires a mature knowledge of the organization, its assets, security environment, and threat landscape but I've seen it effective in some orgs. It's best if you have a research partner like IBM or Verizon to help bring good data to that analysis and this report provides some of that data. It's good to combine this report about the cost of a breach with reports like the X-Force Threat Intelligence Index to understand the threat landscape.   I definitely would put together my own tailored presentation based on this data to my leadership or my clients' leadership rather than just handing them the report. Even most CISOs don't have the time to dig into the research to get the full picture and could use a "what does this mean for my org" type summary. For example, if MFA was either not implemented or in the process of implementation I'd highlight how the report shows that MFA not only prevents breaches but actually limits their impact by the value appropriate to our org's profile as addressed in the report. I'd probably combine several data points from the report (cost by industry, implementation status of several security controls, cost by technical footprint, the potential for mega breaches, and data from other reports) to give a summary of "if we got breached tomorrow, this is how much we could expect it to cost," "here's how we can reduce the likelihood of a breach," and "here's how we can make the impact of a breach less severe" presentation.",countvonruckus,1660257144.0,2,t1_ijwsitc,wl5n37

Thing is, I really needed this delivery ASAP, so of course I go in and check it out.  I land on a DHL delivery information page and click forward. Now I'm asked for card information. ...but... I know how this interaction is supposed to flow. The payment info page looks legit, but it's out of order.  I suddenly snap awake and look at the domain I'm on _for the first time._ It's not DHL. It's nothing like it. I'm on a phishing page. I immediately drop the session and go mark the email as spam.  I'd received a fraudulent email, didn't check the delivery details, clicked a link in the email without checking where it pointed, didn't check where it landed, and just went ahead, because it looked and felt familiar.

I know how these things work and what to look for. I've taught countless people how to spot these things.

XD  If you’re talking about secure deleting something from a public cloud environment, I don’t think any of the above would work, and maybe that’s what you’re concerned with. The trouble there is that since you don’t have “true” access to the hard disk, you are probably too disconnected from the system to ever do anything to technically assure secure deletion. At that point you need to really on a risk management business process where you get the data deletion policies and procedures from them and audit them regularly to ensure these processes are being followed. You can encrypt a file sitting in a cloud storage bucket but you’re effectively controlling everything through APIs at that point and without understanding the full functionality of the APIs you can’t technically be sure that an upload of an encrypted version of a file you just deleted from the cloud actually overwrote or what actually happened at the disk level; that’s just an inherent risk that’s part of the “shared responsibility” model. Most major cloud providers do try to be fairly transparent and descriptive on how they handle data destruction, so these answers are out there, but every cloud provider could be slightly different and there’s no way to implement a technical process to mitigate the fact that at the end of the day you aren’t able to touch the disk where the file is truly stored.

i1hwhlw,"I always appreciate a more senior member of the community engaging with all (even if it was a tad verbose). It's clear that you are very passionate about the subject and dearly want to offer guidance to the upcoming staff.  If I may offer some counterpoints as a devil's advocate:  * I concur with you that - at this time - the formal education vertical is misaligned to the evolving demands of the InfoSec job market. I'm not sure, however, that it is appropriate to assume that will *always* be the case. Having InfoSec as its own subject in academia (worthy of the same degree of scrutiny and academic rigor as its parent subjects: IT/CompSci) is a relatively recent development; as such, the programs that are being stood up are still very exploratory and lacking in standardization. Some programs are spin-offs of the aforementioned IT/CompSci programs, others are more narrowly tailored in teaching towards vendor-developed certifications. Until the academic pipeline matures however, I suspect that there will continue to be an awkward (and challenging) dump-off experience of new graduates into the workforce. * In the meantime, I think it's possible that we encourage the perception of InfoSec less as its own independent area of employment and more of a *specialization* that is built atop professional experience(s). Seen this way, it's quite possible to direct talented individuals into better paying feeder roles (such as software engineering) to later make the transition. This isn't a perfect solution (notably: formal SWE education is almost always lacking in relevant security/network fundamentals), but it can certainly mitigate the strife encountered by new graduates seeking employment. * I concur that *some* YouTube personalities can be insufferable. However (to their credit) they need an edge to get employed just as much as anyone; while I might find some of their content juvenile, misleading, or mistaken, I can't fault them for doing what they need to do to open up options for their own careers. * I think your point of developing a professional network is a fair one in the context of developing layers of employability; knowing someone who can give you your big break can certainly be of help. But we also don't know where that professional relationship will be founded; sure, it may happen in college (as it had for you) but it could also be fostered in being a part of a CTF, contributing to open source GitHub projects, or attending an InfoSec conference. I think it's appropriate that suggesting that "all you need to do is X" is misleading for any of these, as you say; I also agree that any of these are likely to only indirectly aid in one's employability (if at all). However, with the exception of conferences, these are really cost-effective options for exploring InfoSec's subject matter and can help someone trying to figure out early on if the industry is for them or not. As such, I'd contend there is still value (if only intangibly so) in engaging in these ventures.",fabledparable,1647839932.0,10,t3_tiy2lk,tiy2lk

I do not plan to continue schooling unless a future job offers either tuition assistance or pays for it outright. I went to a community college made the best grades that I could and total student loans around 20k.   I worked at a dead end job that was a great place to work if you were satisfied with that style of life.

I currently work as a Security Consultant and when I finished college I had failed college without university entrance so I spent some time working as a teacher aide and pizza delivery driver before deciding I wanted a career in cyber security.  In my mind I planned that I would do some kind of study in I.T, then spend some time in an entry level tech job (I thought either Jr Software Dev, SysAdmin or HelpDesk).  I ended up doing a diploma in software dev (didn't require any uni entrance) and then just applied for every JR looking IT role I could find. I ended up getting a low paying position in customer support for a software startup (of only 4 people at the time). I told my employer I was wanting to work towards a career in cyber security and saw working in the startup as the perfect opportunity to gain experience.  I worked my ass off in that startup and spent a lot of time doing my own learning and research to troubleshoot the various technical issues and software bugs. I also started building apps that helped me do my job and automated various tasks.  As the company grew my role sort of grew with it so after a year of being all things support, we hired other support people, I became more tech support focused, then another year and I was joining the dev team and doing more software development. Another year on and I started managing infrastructure and security for the company before then deciding to apply for a more security specific role at security companies or at least in security teams.  I received advice several times earlier on in my career from seniors in the security field that I should focus on OWASP top 10, learn Burp Suite, Linux and Networking and I'd be ready or prove that I've pwned a bunch of things in HackTheBox. I'm actually glad I didn't just go straight from learning into a security role as I learnt a lot of valuable lessons from the startup I worked at, gained some good business insight and generally had a lot more empathy for the techies of the world which I find some co-workers to lack (those who went straight from Uni into security).  My two cents is don't get so caught up in the idea that you have to be getting all these certs or that you have to be starting in a security specific role. Get a cert if you think it'll help provide you a path of learning, do your own learning and play with CTFs if you enjoy that side, but don't be afraid to just get your foot into IT even if it's a shit paying Help Desk role and I'm sure you'll find your way into your security career from there.",spiderbatz,1647855651.0,5,t3_tiy2lk,tiy2lk

i1iqzjv,"I really attribute my success and climb to the senior engineer level to 2 things: knowing how to speak (specific to your audience), and being able to play the political game that are cost centers (IT, sec, risk, etc.)  These two things are, of course, dependent on getting my your foot in the door. Ways to do that have been pretty well vetted in this thread already.   1. Knowing how to speak. You must be able to speak several different “languages” depending on who you’re talking to. Talking to HR? Be able to speak in very layman’s terms, hitting specific keywords. Talking to a fellow techie? Get down into the weeds with examples. Talking to senior management or the Board? Be able to speak their language and explain metrics and why they matter to the company. I would be nowhere near where I am now if I hadn’t been able to really engage/speak to each specific audience.  2. Understand that, unfortunately, Tech and Sec (and probably others too) is a big political game. Sure, you can get away with not playing politics, but if you have aspirations to move up the corporate ladder, it’s important that you be able to play the political game to your advantage.  Easier said than done, of course. I’m very aware that speaking, for some tech/sec people, can be very difficult. The best advice I can give in that regard is that you must be fully confident in your knowledge. If you don’t know something, don’t be afraid to say “that’s a good question, and I’m not really sure. But I’ll get you an answer on that” and then follow through with that answer. I used to be a terrible speaker, get horrid anxiety over it, and now, I know that if I prepare and am confident in my knowledge and skills, it’ll be fine. Most times, the people you’re talking to have no real clue what you’re saying, so be able to highlight keywords and explain.  Edit - of course you have to know your stuff too. AWS/Azure is the future. AZ-900 is a great place to start with practical Azure knowledge. Kubernetes, as mentioned as well. If you’re new new to the field, learning cloud early is going to be a great way to get started",1anondude69,1647864214.0,3,t3_tiy2lk,tiy2lk
i1j1pu3,"Senior sec engineer here - I also just want to note that often there just *aren’t* entry level cybersecurity jobs. I spent 6 years doing technical jobs that weren’t security before I landed a secure role. Several of those technical jobs were at the “mom and pop” type underpaid positions. Then I finally landed a security job, also at a mom and pop underpaid place that essentially wanted me to architect, build, and run their security program for $50k a year. I did it. Was I underpaid? Yeah. But I also wasn’t qualified to do what they were asking, and in trying I built a halfway okay security program after making some mistakes.  The point is the experience was invaluable, and now, years, I’m at a great tech company with awesome pay, great benefits, exciting work, and I’ve rapidly risen to senior because I know security in and out from experiences.  So my advice would be: - get any technical work experience you can - don’t discount the mom and pop underpaid jobs as a starter point to launch your career",Knight_of_the_Stars,1647870010.0,3,t3_tiy2lk,tiy2lk

I joined this sub a few weeks ago to learn more about the cysec industry, after a company messaged me on LinkedIn to discuss my fit for a position. I thought I'd share my very short story, and maybe that can give another point of view or you can just let me know what you think.  The position is a pre-hire six month internship (very common where I live). I have no cyber security experience* and didn't even expect to work in this field. I was very surprised when they told me it's not an issue, as long as I'm willing to learn. So I applied and they accepted me. I didn't even have a technical interview. The pay is not very high but it's an internship (and pre-hire).   So I guess I end up getting a foot in the field without even asking for it, which seemingly doesn't relate at all with your (this sub in general) experiences. I imagine this internship system works pretty well as it's not a huge investment for the company to hire someone inexperienced.

I went straight to work for Verizon's CISO. After 6 months I said the hell with it because it felt like every other employee is on an H1B1 Visa (that's where all the entry level jobs are going btw). Now I'm doing things like defending the election process from Russia and China (totally a civilian). I suggest that anyone entering the field know the basics. Know the OSI model and be able to describe what's happening to the bits as they transition the stack to include the power grid. Understand DNS and why its vulnerable. Know PC, MAC, and Linux.

Formal education is a thing that students paid for, hence there is a contractual obligation for the schools to prepare the students to the job market as best as possible. There are some spin off cyber sec programs off the comp sci department, but there are also that isn't. Even the ones that are embedded with the college of business are not teaching the students the latest, most relevant skills in their upper class electives in order for them to be ready for today's cyber sec job market, let along being competitive. I feel like if I paid for something, then this thing better be valuable to me. Instead from my research, seems like there is a wide spread of skills mismatch from what people are being taught today than what is expected of them in the job market.  2. Info sec wasn't so much of a specialization when I first started, it was more generalist, but like you said, and partly the reasons I stated above, the boat for that has sailed.

Heck, I haven't even learned how Stacked Queues, Pointers, etc. worked yet in my CS classes and I only did so because of the amazing people at FreeCodeCamp and practicing leetcode.   In Help Desk currently - Since I'm still working on campus we do have an on-premise environment mostly, with VMware, Azure, Active Directory, and Cisco being mostly what we work on as well as local hardwares from Dell and basic end user software issues (ie Installing Adobe PDF reader 1000th time in a row and Microsoft Teams being shoddy as usual).   So now, from what I see - I'm basically self-teaching on my own with my classes only serving as a guide and me just wanting to pass as well as learn something new/ a newer method, instead of really learning for what it is. And I'm a freshie so there's that as well. At least I've learned from doing basic HTML/CSS in my web dev classes & taking AP CS-P in high school to now within a span of now 3 years (Jeez times flies).   However - I'll try to make it up the best I can. I'll install Proxmox on one of the T5810 doesn't have any OS installed on it (The other runs Windows and unfortunately because I'm a dumbass I don't have any Windows device at the moment so I'll keep that one on that OS for now) and then run minikube on it. For Linux - I'll open up an Ubuntu Server VM in Proxmox, but I've already had experience using Fedora (and previously before that Linux Mint) for the past 3 years as well, but still somewhat limited as to what I can do on a Unix operating system.   As for development - I'm going to create a project that is a movie ranking system and I'll figure out a way to add micro-services to that - unfortunately still haven't worked out the detail yet, but it'll be a good summer project once the semester ends.   But also finally - thank you for answering me - As a freshie we all start somewhere, and this will definitely lead me to the good path.

I was literally like 8 questions into a 50 question test before I even recognized material covered under the training.  Well maybe I'm just an idiot so my boss takes it.  He's been working on this vendor's products for literally decades, knows them backwards and forwards and is "the guy" at our office.  Every time he has called support, their dev team had to get involved.  He does the class, studies, takes the test and bombs the fuck out of it.

ijc1ktv,"Yes, I did a NIST CSF based assessment for them last year. As you know, NIST CSF framework does a great job of providing complete coverage from a management/GRC perspective of all the various controls that should be in place for a security program. But at the same time, there are often different approaches that can be taken when it comes to exactly how to implement any given control.  My question wasn't really intended to be a "tell me what technical controls to put in place" post, but rather I was looking for insights from a more strategic perspective in terms of a security architecture that is not so focused on pushing everybody's traffic and access control back through on-prem infrastructure via a VPN.",DoingRelativelyWell,1659893306.0,2,t1_ijbyuca,wiieny
ijc544w,"Ah sweet nice work!  Sounds like you’ve got a decent approach, but the operational side will be the main challenge I reckon.    I would personally invest into the Microsoft suite with MCAS, secuirty  centre, Defender ATP.  If there’s no need for a VPN then probably not worth going that far yet.   Perhaps focus on detective/protective DLP config via intune, MAM policies.  I would probably do a deep dive of their O365 Tennant and get conditional access buttoned down.  You can can limit access to cloud service to only your proxy IP, and enforce MFA/federated secuirty wherever possible.   Out of interest, what was your approach for the NIST CSF assessment?

Most of the columns I do not actually use in just a compliance assessment process as I feel a lot of it is based around long-term planning and budgeting. I add a column for notes after the control title, and I just have a series of conversations. For a few of them that are somewhat opaque in meaning like "identities are proofed and bound to credentials asserted in interactions" or "unauthorized mobile code is detected" I have additional notes and references I keep in my own copy of the tool to help me explain the control to the customer.

iipv94b,"ETW events could be registered by some of the APIs, maybe. But ETW isn't always reliable, since the event triggers are often part of processes controllable or modifiable from userland.  Edit, to elaborate:  If I recall ETW fundamentals correctly, you have event consumers and producers, basically, and the producers are essentially just something you trigger in your code ("you" in this case more often being a Windows dev, since their components use ETW events heavily for debugging). So if "your code" is a Windows API (DLL) being used by some other dev, which is how most PEs work (importing DLLs representing Windows OS APIs and calling the exposed subroutines to interface with various Windows abstraction layers), well, that DLL's run-time state can be modified by any attacker achieving shellcode execution in order to remove or limit that ETW event production.  I could definitely be off; I have not (yet) gone hands-on with ETW other than knowing it's what produces the many very useful .etl files (which are very similar in nature to the .evtx files where all Windows Event Logs are stored). It's something I definitely intend to understand better.  Tl;Dr: If a mechanism relies on code executing within the shared memory space of a DLL (as much behavior tracking by endpoint security products and security logging does), it is essentially trivial to defeat. This is basically the key challenge I'm facing with my research on this subject of process I/O tracking so far; injection is a form of process I/O that I don't see a kernel-enforced hooking mechanism to track in Windows.",Jonathan-Todd,1659486357.0,1,t1_iipqd71,weqfuk

iizpo85,"Not yet. Studied all this at a conceptual level. Reading Windows Internals Vol 7 currently, then studying C++ and reading a kernel driver dev book. Then I'll test it for myself.  My current understanding is that the events are triggered by routines called in your code, meaning unless your code is running in kernel mode (some/many ETW events *are* triggered here) attacker doesn't need special privs to delete or modify the events. It depends on the process triggering the events.  Some of this understanding is rather intuitive on top of reading the documentation on ETW; just look at the info in the ETW events. They're clearly informed by information from the process triggering them, therefore you can certainly modify the process to stop triggering them unless it's a kernel mode or protected process / PPL.  If I have that right, it's important because I *believe*Windows Event Logs rely on ETW, which means if any of those events are triggered inside the usermode DLLs (OS APIs), those are potentially unreliable events that we in the DFIR profession rely on for investigation.  Enough speculation from memory, let's refer back to the docs (emphasis my own):  > Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is an efficient kernel-level tracing facility that lets you log kernel **or application-defined** events to a log file  > The Event Tracing API is broken into three distinct components: > - Controllers, which start and stop an event tracing session and enable providers > - Providers, which provide the events > - Consumers, which consume the events  Providers can be in user or kernel processes. It just depends on which events we're talking about. I bet someone on github has mapped different events to different processes for the corresponding providers.",Jonathan-Todd,1659660017.0,1,t1_iizkqdt,weqfuk
