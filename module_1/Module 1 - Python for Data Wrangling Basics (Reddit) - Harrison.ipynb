I was looking at /r/Phoenix because I wanted to extract place-based comments and learn from them. Here you are looking for particular keywords, within a particular timeframe. Design an extractor that does this, and also saves the dates and times of these comments to a human-readable version. It should also only collect the last 72 hours-worth of data.\n","\n","Describe what you have done--particularly where it departs from the model we created--in the text (Markdown) cells in your notebook.
